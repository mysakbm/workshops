The game changed while I lay rotting\\n            in my bed, and no one will tell me the rules.\\n        — George R.R. Martin, A Song of Ice and Fire\\nThis document is intended as the definitive source for rules information, but does not teach players how to play\\n        the game. Players should first read the Learn to Play book in its entirety and use this Rules Reference as\\n        needed while playing the game.\\nThe majority of this guide consists of the glossary, which provides an alphabetical listing of terms and\\n        situations a player might encounter during a game. This section should be the first destination for players who\\n        have a rules question.\\nThe latter part of this guide contains two appendices. The first appendix provides detailed timing diagrams that\\n        illustrate the structure of an entire game round, as well as a detailed explanation on how to handle each game\\n        step presented in those diagrams. The second provides a detailed anatomy of each cardtype.\\nThe Golden Rules\\nIf the text of this Rules Reference directly contradicts the text of the Learn to Play book, the text of the\\n        Rules Reference takes precedence.\\nIf the text of a card directly contradicts the text of either the Rules Reference or the Learn to Play book, the\\n        text of the card takes precedence.\\nGlossary\\nThe following is an alphabetical list of entries for game rules, terms, and situations that may occur during\\n        play.\\nAbilities\\nAn ability is the special game text that a card contributes to the game. Card abilities fall into one of the\\n        following types: actions, constant abilities, interrupts, keywords, reactions, or when revealed abilities.\\n\\n The initiation of action, interrupt, and reaction abilities is optional. The word \"may\" also incorporates a\\n            player option into the resolution of an ability. The player who controls the card on which an optional\\n            ability exists determines whether or not he or she wishes to use that ability at the appropriate time.\\n        \\n The application or initiation of the following types of abilities is mandatory: constant abilities, when\\n            revealed abilities, forced interrupt abilities, and forced reaction abilities.\\n        \\n The initiation of any keyword which uses the word \"may\" in its keyword description is optional. The\\n            application of all other keywords is mandatory.\\n        \\n Card abilities only interact with, and can only target, cards that are in play, unless the ability text\\n            specifically refers to an out of play area or element. Card abilities on characters, locations, and\\n            attachments can only be initiated or affect the game from an in play area unless they specifically refer to\\n            being used from an out of play area, or require that the card be out of play for the ability to resolve.\\n            Event cards and agenda cards implicitly interact with the game from an out of play area, as established by\\n            the rules of their cardtypes.\\n        \\n A card ability can only be initiated if its effect has the potential to change the game state. This\\n            potential is assessed without taking into account the consequences of the cost payment or any other ability\\n            interactions.\\n        \\n A card ability can only be initiated if its cost (after modifiers) has the potential to be paid in full.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Actions, Effects, Constant Abilities, Costs, Delayed Effects, Forced\\n            Interrupts/Forced Reactions, In Play and Out of Play, Interrupts, Keywords, Lasting\\n            Effects, Reactions, Triggered Abilities, When Revealed\\nActions\\nAn action is a triggered ability that contains the boldface \"Action:\" precursor. These abilities\\n        can only be initiated by a player during an action window. For details on when action windows occur during each\\n        round, see the timing charts in Appendix I.\\nSome Action abilities have a phase name as a qualifier to the word \"Action.\" Such abilities are still considered\\n        Action abilities, with the restriction that they can only be initiated during an action window in the specified\\n        phase.\\nAn action must be resolved completely before the next action can be initiated.\\nRelated: In Play and Out of Play\\nActive Player\\nIn some phases, the game creates an active player, who is granted permission to perform a specified task.\\n\\n During the marshaling phase, the active player collects income and is also permitted to marshal character,\\n            location, attachment, and duplicate cards from his or her hand.\\n        \\n During the challenges phase, the active player is permitted to initiate challenges.\\n\\nRelated: Marshaling Phase, Challenges\\n            Phase\\nAgainst\\nDuring a challenge, the attacking player and the defending player are considered to be taking part in the\\n        challenge \"against\" each other.\\nAgenda Cards\\nAgenda cards are placed alongside a player\\'s faction card, and provide specialized abilities and limitations for\\n        his or her deck. A player may use a single agenda card in conjunction with his or her faction card when\\n        assembling a deck. The agenda card starts the game next to a player\\'s faction card and is revealed along with\\n        the faction card during setup.\\n\\n Agenda cards are not considered \"in play.\" Their text affects the game state from the out of play area\\n            while they are active beside a player\\'s faction card.\\n        \\n Cards with the printed agenda cardtype cannot be removed from the game by other card abilities.\\n\\nRelated: In Play and Out of Play, Deckbuilding\\nAmbush (X)\\nAmbush is a keyword ability. A player may, as a player action during the challenges phase, pay gold equal to the\\n        (X) value of a card with ambush to put that card into play from his or her hand. A card that enters play using\\n        ambush is not considered to have been marshaled.\\n\\n If a card has multiple instances of ambush, each with a different (X) value, the player controlling the\\n            card may choose which instance of ambush is used to put the card into play.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Keywords, Put into Play\\nAssault\\nAssault is a keyword ability. When a character with assault is declared as an attacker in a challenge,\\n        that character’s controller may choose a location with lower printed cost controlled by the defending player.\\n        The chosen location is considered to be targeted by assault. Until the end of the challenge,\\n        treat it as if its printed text box were blank (except for Traits).\\n        Unless otherwise stated by a card ability, only one location may be targeted using assault in each challenge.\\n        When a player wins a challenge in which they control 1 or more attacking characters with assault,\\n        any location that was targeted by assault in that challenge is knelt.\\n\\nThe target for assault is chosen at the same time as targets for stealth are chosen,\\n            before reactions to the challenge being initiated can be triggered.\\n            If a challenge is redirected using the Crown Regent melee title,\\n            the attacking player may choose a new target for assault.\\n            The previously chosen target is not considered to have been targeted by assault and remains unaffected.\\nOnce a challenge is initiated, a location targeted by assault will remain blanked for the duration\\n            of the challenge (until step 4.2.6), even if the defending player wins the challenge,\\n            or if any attacking character with assault is removed from the challenge or loses the assault keyword.\\n            If a location that was targeted by assault leaves play during a challenge,\\n            all effects of assault on that card expire.\\nWhen a player wins a challenge in which they control 1 or more attacking characters with assault,\\n            any location that was targeted by assault in that challenge is knelt.\\n            This happens immediately after the winner of the challenge is determined,\\n            before any reactions (forced or otherwise) to winning or losing that challenge can be initiated.\\n            For the location to be knelt, the only check that is made is whether there is a character with assault\\n            participating on the attacking player’s side.\\n            It does not matter whether that specific character targeted that location using assault\\n            when the challenge was initiated.\\nIf a location is kneeling, or if its printed text box is already treated as if it were blank,\\n            that location is still an eligible target for assault.\\n            A location that \"cannot be knelt by assault\" may still be targeted by assault,\\n            but it will not be knelt if the attacking player wins the challenge.\\n            A location that \"cannot be targeted by assault\" is not an eligible choice\\n            when the assault target is chosen.\\n\\nAn example of how assault may be used during a challenge:\\n            Kristin initiates a challenge against Magnus and declares\\n            Dagmer Cleftjaw (Westeros, 111)\\n            and The Iron Fleet (For the Realm, 4)\\n            as attackers.\\n            Since The Iron Fleet has the assault keyword, Kristin chooses\\n            The Wall (Core, 137) as the target of assault.\\n            The printed text box of The Wall is now treated as if it were blank,\\n            so it no longer provides +1 STR to each  character Magnus controls.\\n            Magnus determines that he cannot successfully defend the challenge.\\n            He would like The Wall to remain standing so that he could trigger its Interrupt ability at the end of the phase.\\n            He plays Nightmares (Westeros, 99)\\n            on The Iron Fleet, removing its assault keyword.\\n            In order to kneel The Wall, Kristin knows that she needs to control a participating character\\n            with assault at the point when the winner of the challenge is determined,\\n            so she uses Silence (Kings of the Isles, 16)\\n            to put Foamdrinker (For the Realm, 5)\\n            into play from her hand.\\n            Dagmer Cleftjaw now gains assault from Foamdrinker’s constant ability.\\n            When Kristin wins the challenge, The Wall is knelt.\\n        \\nAttachment Cards\\nAttachment cards represent weapons, armor, items, skills, conditions, and titles. These cards enter play standing\\n        and attached to another card or game element, and remain in play unless removed by an ability, or unless the\\n        attached card leaves play. An attachment cannot enter play if there is no eligible card or game element to which\\n        it can attach.\\n\\n An attachment can only attach to a character, unless otherwise specified by the attachment\\'s text.\\n There is no limit on the number of attachments that may be attached to a card or game element.\\n If a card to which an attachment is attached leaves play, return the attachment to its owner\\'s hand. This\\n            occurs simultaneously with the attached card leaving play.\\n        \\n If a situation arises in which an attachment is not legally attached, discard the attachment.\\n An attachment a player controls remains under his or her control even if the card or game element to which\\n            it is attached is under an opponent\\'s control.\\n        \\n An attachment card stands and kneels independently of the card to which it is attached.\\n\\nRelated: Ownership and Control\\nAttacker, Attacking Character, Attacking Player\\nThe term \"attacking character\" refers to a character that is participating in a challenge on the side of the\\n        player who initiated the challenge. The term \"attacker\" is also used as shorthand for \"attacking character.\"\\nThe term \"attacking player\" refers to the player that initiated the challenge that is currently resolving.\\nRelated: Challenges Phase, Defender, Participating\\nBase Value\\nThe value of a quantity before any modifiers are applied. For most quantities, it is also the printed value.\\nRelated: Printed, Modifiers\\nBestow\\nBestow is a keyword ability. When a card with bestow (X) enters play, the card\\'s controller may move up to X gold from his or her gold pool to that card. This decision is made immediately upon the card entering play, after resolving any interrupts to the card entering play but prior to triggering any reactions (forced or otherwise) to the card entering play.\\n\\n  When placing gold using bestow, a player may choose any amount of gold, up to the (X) value of the card with bestow. (For example, when a card with \"bestow (2)\" enters play, its controller may move 0, 1, or 2 gold from his or her gold pool to that card.)\\n  Gold on a card is not in its controller\\'s gold pool. Game steps and abilities that use or interact with gold in a player\\'s gold pool do not interact with gold on cards.\\n  When gold is discarded from a card with bestow, it is returned to the treasury.\\n\\nBlank\\nIf a card\\'s printed text box is considered \"blank\" by an ability, that text box is treated as if it did not have\\n        any of its printed content. Text and/or icons gained from another source are not blanked.\\n\\n A card\\'s text box includes: traits, keywords, card text and abilities, and non-challenge icons (such as\\n            gold, initiative, and reserve modifiers).\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Printed\\nCancel\\nSome card abilities (usually interrupt abilities) can \"cancel\" other card or game effects. Cancel abilities\\n        interrupt the initiation of an effect, and prevent the effect from initiating. Because of this, cancel abilities\\n        have timing priority over all other interrupts to the effect that is attempting to initiate.\\n\\n When an effect is canceled, that effect is no longer imminent, and further interrupts (including cancels)\\n            cannot be initiated in reference to the canceled effect.\\n        \\n When the effects of an ability are canceled, the ability is still considered to have been used, and any\\n            costs have still been paid.\\n        \\n If the effects of an event card are canceled, the card is still considered to have been played, and it is\\n            still placed in its owner\\'s discard pile.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Costs, Initiating\\n            Abilities, Interrupts, Limits and Maxima, Triggering Condition\\nCannot\\nThe word \"cannot\" is absolute, and cannot be countermanded by other abilities.\\nCardtypes\\n\\n If an ability causes a card to change its cardtype (such as an event card that changes into an attachment),\\n            it loses all other cardtypes it might possess and functions as would any card of the new cardtype.\\n        \\n\\nChallenge Icons\\nThese icons appear on most character cards and indicate which challenge types the character may be declared for\\n        as an attacker or defender. The challenge icons are:\\n\\n\\n\\nChallenge\\nGraphic Icon\\nIn Text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMilitary\\n\\n[military]\\n\\n\\nIntrigue\\n\\n[intrigue]\\n\\n\\nPower\\n\\n[power]\\n\\n\\n\\nChallenges Phase\\nSee Appendix I, \"4. Challenges phase\".\\nCharacter Cards\\nCharacter cards represent the lords, ladies, knights, armies, mercenaries, creatures, and other personalities and\\n        groups one might encounter in the A Song of Ice and Fire setting. These cards enter play in the front\\n        row of a player\\'s play area and remain in play unless removed by an ability or game effect.\\nChoose\\nThe word \"choose\" indicates that one or more targets must be chosen in order to resolve an ability.\\nRelated: Target\\nClaim or Claim Value\\nClaim represents the consequences a player must face upon losing a challenge as the defending player.\\nThe claim value on a player\\'s revealed plot card (which incorporates all relevant claim modifiers) determines the\\n        potency of each challenge that player initiates if he or she wins the challenge.\\nClaim value determines: how many different characters the losing opponent must kill (for a [military] challenge),\\n        how many cards are discarded from the losing opponent\\'s hand (for an [intrigue] challenge), or how much power is\\n        taken from the losing opponent\\'s faction card (for a [power] challenge).\\nRelated: Intrigue Claim, Military\\n            Claim, Power Claim\\nConstant Abilities\\nA constant ability is any non-keyword ability whose text contains no boldface precursor defining its ability\\n        type. A constant ability becomes active as soon as its card enters play and remains active while that card is in\\n        play.\\n\\n Some constant abilities continuously seek a specific condition (denoted by words such as \"during,\" \"if,\" or\\n            \"while\"). The effects of such abilities are active any time the specified condition is met.\\n        \\n If multiple instances of the same constant ability are in play, each instance affects the game state.\\n\\nRelated: In Play and Out of Play\\nControl\\nSee \"Ownership and Control\".\\nCopy (of a card)\\nA copy of a card is defined by title: any other card that shares the same title is considered a copy, regardless\\n        of cardtype, text, artwork, or any other characteristic of the card(s).\\nRelated: Deckbuilding, Ownership\\n            and Control, Unique Cards, Self-Referential\\n            Text\\nCosts\\nA card\\'s gold cost is the numerical value that must be paid to marshal or play the card.\\nSome card abilities are presented in a \"do X to do Y\" construct. In such a construct, the \"do X\" aspect\\n        (preceding the word \"to\") is a cost, and the \"do Y\" aspect (following the word \"to\") is an effect.\\n\\n An opponent\\'s game elements may not be used to pay a cost.\\n If a cost requires a game element that is not in play, the player paying the cost may only use game\\n            elements that are in his or her out of play areas and/or gold pool to pay the cost.\\n        \\n If multiple costs for a single card or ability require payment, those costs must be paid simultaneously.\\n        \\n If any part of a cost payment is prevented, once all costs that can be paid are paid, the process of\\n            initiating the ability or marshaling/playing the card immediately ends without further resolution. (The card\\n            remains unplayed in its owner\\'s hand.)\\n        \\n An ability cannot initiate (and therefore its costs cannot be paid) if the resolution of its effect will\\n            not change the game state.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: In Play and Out of Play, Ownership and Control\\nDead Pile\\nThe dead pile is an out of play area. It is distinct from the discard pile.\\n\\n Any time a character in play is \"killed,\" that character is placed faceup on top of its owner\\'s dead\\n            pile.\\n        \\n A player cannot marshal, play, put into play, or take control of a copy of any unique ([unique]) card that\\n            is in his or her dead pile.\\n        \\n A single instance of a unique card in a player\\'s dead pile does not prevent an effect that would\\n            cause the card to enter play directly from the dead pile. This is because such an effect removes the only\\n            instance of the card from the dead pile.\\n        \\n Each player\\'s dead pile is open information, and may be looked at by any player at any time.\\n The order of the cards in a dead pile may not be altered unless a player is instructed to do so by a card\\n            ability.\\n        \\n If multiple characters are killed simultaneously, the owner of the cards may physically place them into his\\n            or her dead pile one at a time, in any order.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Discard Pile, Leaves Play, Unique Cards\\nDeck, Draw Deck\\nWhen the word \"deck\" appears by itself in rules or in card text, it refers to the deck that contains a player\\'s\\n        attachment, character, event, and location cards. This is also known as the \"draw deck.\"\\nAny rule or ability that refers to a plot deck uses the term \"plot deck.\"\\nRelated: Plot Deck\\nDeckbuilding\\nTo build a custom deck for sanctioned tournament play:\\n\\n A player must choose exactly 1 faction card.\\n A player may choose 1 agenda card, or may choose to not use an agenda.\\n A player\\'s plot deck must contain exactly 7 cards. Up to one of the chosen plot cards may be duplicated\\n            once (by title) within the plot deck. No more than 1 copy of each of the other plot cards may be in the plot\\n            deck.\\n        \\n A player\\'s draw deck must contain a minimum of 60 cards.\\n There is no upper limit on a player\\'s draw deck size.\\n A player\\'s draw deck can only contain up to 3 copies (by title) of any given card.\\n Unless instructed otherwise by a card ability, each card in a player\\'s deck and plot deck must be neutral\\n            or its affiliation must match the affiliation of that player\\'s faction card.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Copy, Deck, Deck\\n            Limits, Faction, Plot Deck\\nDeck Limits, Deck Limit: X\\nUp to 3 copies of most cards (by title) may be included in a player\\'s deck. If a card has the text \"Deck Limit:\\n        X\" no more than X copies of that card may be included in a player\\'s deck.\\n\\n If X is 2 or lower, this phrase acts as a deckbuilding restriction.\\n If X is 4 or higher, this phrase acts as a permission that enables a player to include more than the\\n            standard 3 copies.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Plot Deck Limit: X\\nDefender, Defending Character, Defending Player\\nThe term \"defending character\" refers to a character that is participating in a challenge on the side of the\\n        defending player. The term \"defender\" may also be used as shorthand for \"defending character.\"\\nThe term \"defending player\" refers to the opponent of the attacking player against whom (from the attacking\\n        player\\'s perspective) the challenge is resolving.\\nRelated: Attacker, Challenges Phase, Participating\\nDelayed Effects\\nSome abilities contain delayed effects. Such abilities specify a future timing point, or indicate a future\\n        condition that may arise, and dictate an effect that is to happen at that time.\\n\\n Delayed effects resolve automatically and immediately after their timing point/future condition occurs,\\n            before reactions to that moment may be used.\\n        \\n When a delayed effect resolves, it is not treated as a new triggered ability, even if the delayed effect\\n            was originally created by a triggered ability.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Abilities, Effects, Triggered Abilities\\nDiscard Pile\\nThe discard pile is an out of play area. It is distinct from the dead pile.\\n\\n Any time a card is \"discarded\" (from play or from an out of play area such as a hand or deck), it is placed\\n            faceup on top of its owner\\'s discard pile.\\n        \\n Each player\\'s discard pile is open information, and may be looked at by any player at any time.\\n The order of the cards in a discard pile may not be altered unless a player is instructed to do so by a\\n            card ability.\\n        \\n If multiple cards are discarded simultaneously, the owner of the cards may physically place them into his\\n            or her discard pile one at a time, in any order.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Dead Pile, Leaves Play, Sacrifice\\nDominance Phase\\nSee Appendix I, \"5. Dominance phase\".\\nDrawing Cards\\nWhen a player is instructed to draw one or more cards, those cards are drawn from the top of his or her draw\\n        deck.\\n\\n When a player draws 2 or more cards as the result of a single ability or game step, those cards are all\\n            drawn simultaneously.\\n        \\n Drawn cards are added to a player\\'s hand.\\n There is no limit to the number of cards a player may draw each round.\\n\\nRelated: Reserve Value\\nDraw Phase\\nSee Appendix I, \"2. Draw phase\".\\nDuplicates\\nA player may use additional copies, by title, of any unique card (indicated by a \"[unique]\" symbol in its title)\\n        he or she owns and controls in play as duplicates. When a card enters play as a duplicate, it is placed faceup,\\n        overlapped by (i.e. partially visible beneath) the copy of the card that was already in play.\\nA duplicate grants its controller the following triggered game ability: \"Interrupt: When the\\n        overlapping unique card would leave play, discard this duplicate to save that card. (Cannot be canceled.)\"\\n\\n There is no cost to marshal a card as a duplicate.\\n Duplicates are not considered attachments. Duplicates are not affected by and do not interact with text\\n            that refers to attachments.\\n        \\n Duplicates have no text, titles, characteristics, type, or traits. A duplicate is only considered a blank\\n            \"duplicate card\" while it is in play.\\n        \\n It is possible to have more than one duplicate on a single card.\\n A different version of a unique card may be used as a duplicate on the card. The version of the card that\\n            was first in play remains as the active version once the duplicate is attached. A player may not switch a\\n            card with its duplicate.\\n        \\n Marshaling a duplicate is not considered marshaling a card of the duplicate\\'s printed type. It is only\\n            considered \"marshaling a duplicate card.\"\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Ownership and Control, Save,\\n        Unique Cards\\nEffects\\nA card effect is any effect that arises from the resolution of ability text printed on, or gained by, a card. A\\n        framework effect is any effect that arises from the resolution of a framework event.\\n\\n Card effects might be preceded by costs, triggering conditions, play restrictions, and/or play permissions;\\n            such elements are not considered effects.\\n        \\n Once initiated, players must resolve as much of each aspect of the effect as they are able, unless the\\n            effect uses the word \"may.\"\\n        \\n When a non-targeting effect attempts to engage a number of entities (such as \"draw 3 cards\" or \"search the\\n            top 10 cards of your deck\") that exceeds the number of entities that currently exist in the specified game\\n            area, the effect engages as many entities as possible.\\n        \\n The expiration of a lasting effect (or the cessation of a constant ability) is not considered to be\\n            generating a game state change by a card effect.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Abilities, Costs, Delayed Effects, Lasting Effects, May, Initiating Abilities, Play Restrictions and Permissions, Triggering Condition\\nEnters Play\\nThe phrase \"enters play\" refers to any time a card makes a transition from an out of play area into a play area.\\n        Marshaling a card and putting a card into play by using a card ability are two means by which a card may enter\\n        play.\\nRelated: In Play and Out of Play, Marshal,\\n        Put into Play\\nEvent Cards\\nEvent cards represent tactical actions, schemes, twists of fate, and other unexpected developments that might\\n        occur during the game.\\n\\n An event card\\'s ability type, triggering condition (if any), and play permissions/restrictions (if any)\\n            define when and how the card can be played.\\n        \\n When a player plays an event card, its costs are paid, its effects are resolved (or canceled), and the card\\n            is placed in its owner\\'s discard pile prior to opening the reaction window which follows the ability\\'s\\n            resolution.\\n        \\n Event card effects engage the game state at the time they resolve. If an event card creates a\\n            lasting effect on a set of cards, only cards that are in play at the time the event card is played are\\n            eligible to be affected. Cards that enter play after the resolution of the event are not affected by its\\n            lasting effect.\\n        \\n If the effects of an event card are canceled, the card is still considered to have been played, and its\\n            costs remain paid. Only the effects have been canceled.\\n        \\n Unless the ability that puts it into play also changes its cardtype to a cardtype that is permitted in\\n            play, an event card cannot enter play.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Cancel, Costs, Delayed\\n            Effects, Lasting Effects, Play\\n            Restrictions and Permissions, Triggering Condition\\nFacedown Cards\\nSome abilities put cards into play facedown. A facedown card has no inherent attributes other than \"facedown\\n        card,\" but it may be granted attributes by the card ability that put it into play.\\n\\n A player may look at the identity of any facedown card that is in play and under his or her control.\\n\\nFaction, Faction Cards\\nThere are 8 factions in the game, shown in the chart below.\\nThe faction card signals which faction a player has chosen as the primary faction for his or her deck.

A new first player is chosen each plot phase by the player who\\n        wins initiative. The chosen player remains the first player until a new first player is chosen. The first player\\n        token is used to indicate which player is the first player.\\n\\n The first player becomes the active player first during the marshaling and challenges phases.\\n During all framework event and action/reaction/ interrupt windows the first player has the first\\n            opportunity to initiate action, interrupt, or reaction abilities at each appropriate game moment.\\n        \\n For any question as to who should perform an act or make a decision first, in the absence of any other\\n            direction by card or rules text, the first player does so first, and other players follow in player order.\\n        \\n If the first player is eliminated from a game, the player to his or her left becomes the first player.\\n\\nRelated: Active Player, Setup, Initiative, Plot Phase, Priority of Simultaneous Resolution\\nForced Interrupts / Forced Reactions\\nWhile most triggered abilities are optional, some interrupt and reaction abilities are preceded by the word\\n        \"Forced.\" Such abilities must be resolved immediately whenever the triggering condition specified in the ability\\n        text occurs.\\n\\n For any given triggering condition, forced interrupts take priority and initiate before non-forced\\n            interrupts, and forced reactions take priority and initiate before non-forced reactions.\\n        \\n If two or more forced abilities would initiate at the same moment, the first player determines the order in\\n            which the abilities initiate, regardless of who controls the cards bearing those abilities.\\n        \\n Each forced ability must resolve completely before the next forced ability to the same triggering condition\\n            may initiate.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Interrupts, Reactions\\nFor Your Faction\\nThe phrase \"for your faction\" is used to instruct a player to place the power just gained on his or her faction\\n        card.\\nFramework Effects and Framework Events\\nA framework event is a mandatory occurrence dictated by the structure of the game. A framework effect is any\\n        effect that arises from the resolution of a framework event.\\nRelated: Appendix I: Timing and Gameplay, Effects\\nGains\\nThe word \"gains\" is used in multiple contexts.\\n\\n If a player gains gold, the player takes the specified amount of gold from the treasury and adds it to his\\n            or her gold pool.\\n        \\n If a player gains power for a card under his or her control, the player takes the specified amount of power\\n            from the treasury and adds it to the card.\\n        \\n If a card gains a characteristic (such as an icon, a Trait, a keyword, or ability\\n            text), the card functions as if it possesses the gained characteristic. Gained characteristics are not\\n            considered to be printed on the card.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Gold, Power, Printed\\n\\nGold\\nGold is the game\\'s currency and is used to pay for cards and card abilities. The amount of gold a player has\\n        available at any given time is represented (as open information) by gold tokens in his or her gold pool.\\nGold begins the game in the treasury. When a player gains gold, that player takes an equivalent amount of gold\\n        from the treasury and adds it to his or her gold pool. When gold is spent it is returned to the treasury from a\\n        player\\'s gold pool.\\nRelated: Marshaling Phase, Taxation\\n            Phase\\nGold Modifier\\nSee \"Plot Value Modifiers\".\\nImmune\\nIf a card is immune to a specified set of effects (for example, \"immune to event card effects,\" or \"immune to\\n        [tyrell] card effects\"), it cannot be targeted or affected by effects that belong to that set. Only the card\\n        itself is protected, and peripheral entities associated with an immune card (such as attachments, tokens,\\n        abilities originating from an immune card, or duplicates) are not themselves immune.\\nIf a card gains immunity to an effect, pre-existing lasting effects that have been applied to the card are not\\n        removed.\\nImmunity only protects a card from effects. It does not prevent a card from being used to pay costs.\\nRelated: Costs, Lasting Effects\\nIn Play and Out of Play\\nThe cards (generally characters, locations, attachments, duplicates, and the faction card) that a player controls\\n        in the play area, the title card a player currently bears in a melee game, as well as a player\\'s revealed plot\\n        card, are considered \"in play.\"\\n\"Out of play\" refers to all other cards and areas involved in the game environment, including: cards in a\\n        player\\'s hand, deck, discard pile, dead pile, plot deck, used pile, agendas, and any cards that have been\\n        removed from the game.\\n\\n A card enters play when it transitions from an out of play origin to a play area.\\n A card leaves play when it transitions from a play area to an out of play destination.\\n A player\\'s faction card cannot leave play.\\n Outside of the process by which a player reveals a new plot and his or her previously revealed plot card\\n            enters the used pile, a player\\'s plot card cannot leave play.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Abilities, Dead Pile, Deck, Discard Pile, Plot Card\\nIncome\\nWhen a player becomes the active player during the marshaling phase, that player collects income by gaining an\\n        amount of gold from the treasury equal to the gold value on his or her revealed plot card (which incorporates\\n        the total value of all relevant gold modifiers).\\nRelated: Gold, Gold Modifier, Marshaling Phase\\nInfluence Tokens\\nInfluence tokens are generic tokens that can be used to track a variety of different game states and statuses.\\n        They have no inherent rules.\\n\\n Card abilities can create and define a number of different token types, such as \"betrayal tokens,\" \"poison\\n            tokens,\" and \"stand tokens.\" When such a token is called for, an influence token is used to track its\\n            presence in the game.\\n        \\n\\nInitiating Abilities / Marshaling Cards\\nWhen a player wishes to marshal or play a card, or initiate a triggered ability, that player first declares his\\n        or her intent (and shows the card to be used, if necessary). The following steps are then observed, in\\n        order:\\n\\n Check play restrictions: can the card be marshaled or played, or the ability initiated, at this time?\\n Determine the cost (or costs, if multiple costs are required) to marshal/play the card or initiate the\\n            ability. If it is established that the cost (taking modifiers into account) can be paid, proceed with the\\n            remaining steps of this sequence.\\n        \\n Apply any modifiers to the cost(s).\\n Pay the cost(s).\\n Choose target(s), if applicable.\\n The card is marshaled/played, or the effects of the ability attempt to initiate. An interrupt ability that\\n            cancels this initiation may be used at this time.\\n        \\n The effects of the ability (if not canceled in step 6) complete their initiation, and resolve.\\n\\nInterrupts and Reactions may be used throughout this process as normal, should their triggering conditions\\n        occur.\\nRelated: Abilities, Cancel, Costs,\\n        Play Restrictions and Permissions, Target\\n\\nInitiative\\nA player\\'s initiative is the initiative value on his or her revealed plot card (which incorporates the total\\n        value of all relevant initiative modifiers).\\nWhen new plot cards are revealed for the plot phase, the players compare initiative. The player with the highest\\n        initiative value wins initiative, and chooses which player is the \"first player\" until a new first player is\\n        chosen.\\nIf there is a tie at that time for initiative, the tied player with the lowest power total wins initiative. If\\n        the lowest power total is also tied, a random method should be used to break this tie.\\nRelated: First Player\\nInitiative Modifier\\nSee \"Plot Value Modifiers\".\\nInsight\\nInsight is a challenge resolution keyword. After a player wins a challenge, for each participating character with\\n        the insight keyword he or she controls, that player may draw 1 card.\\nRelated: Challenges Phase, Keywords\\nInstead\\nSee \"Replacement Effects\".\\nInterrupts\\nAn interrupt is a triggered ability whose text contains the boldface \"Interrupt:\" precursor. An\\n        interrupt ability interrupts the resolution of its triggering condition, sometimes canceling or changing the\\n        resolution of that condition. Always resolve interrupts to a triggering condition before resolving the\\n        consequences of the triggering condition itself.\\nUnlike actions, which may be initiated during action windows, each interrupt may be initiated once each\\n        time its specified triggering condition occurs, as described in the interrupt\\'s ability text.\\nWhen a triggering condition initiates (but before it begins resolving), an interrupt window for that triggering\\n        condition opens.\\nWithin the interrupt window, the first player always has the first opportunity to initiate an eligible interrupt\\n        (to this triggering condition), or pass. Opportunities to initiate an eligible interrupt, or pass, continue in\\n        player order until all players consecutively pass, at which point the interrupt window closes. Passing does not\\n        prevent a player from initiating an eligible interrupt later in that same interrupt window.\\nOnce an interrupt window closes, further interrupts to that specific triggering condition cannot be initiated.\\n        The triggering condition now completes its resolution (as long as its effects have not been canceled).\\n\\n It is possible for multiple interrupts to be initiated from the same triggering condition. Each interrupt\\n            must resolve completely before the next interrupt to the same triggering condition may initiate.\\n        \\n If multiple copies of the same interrupt are eligible to be initiated, each copy may be initiated once\\n            against that triggering condition.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Cancel, First Player, Forced Interrupts/Forced Reactions, Nested Ability Sequences, The word\\n            \"Would\"\\nIntimidate\\nIntimidate is a challenge resolution keyword. After a player wins a challenge as the attacking player in which he\\n        or she controls a character with the intimidate keyword, that player may choose and kneel a character,\\n        controlled by the losing opponent, with equal or lower STR than the amount of STR by which the challenge was\\n        won. (The chosen character is not required to be participating in the challenge.)\\n\\n No more than one instance of intimidate can successfully resolve during each challenge.\\n\\nRelated: Challenges Phase, Keywords\\nIntrigue Claim\\nWhen a player loses an intrigue ([intrigue]) challenge as the defending player, that player must discard a number\\n        of random cards from his or her hand equal to the claim value on the attacking player\\'s revealed plot card.\\nIf the player has fewer cards in hand than would satisfy claim, as much of the claim as possible must be\\n        satisfied.\\nRelated: Challenges Phase\\nJoust Game\\nA joust game is a head-to-head game between two players.\\n\\n Melee title cards, and their associated framework steps (1.4 and 7.4, see Appendix\\n                I), are not used in a joust game.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Melee Game\\nKeywords\\nA keyword is a card ability which conveys specific rules to its card.\\n\\n Sometimes a keyword is followed by reminder text, which is presented in italics. Reminder text is a\\n            shorthand explanation of how a keyword works, but it is not rules text and does not replace the rules for\\n            that keyword in this glossary.\\n        \\n Cards are considered to have a keyword or to not have that keyword. A single card that has and/or is\\n            gaining the same keyword from multiple sources functions as if it has one instance of that keyword. (Note:\\n            Instances of Ambush (X) with different values for X are considered different keywords.)\\n        \\n The keywords in the game are: ambush (X), assault, bestow (X), insight, intimidate, limited,\\n            no attachments, pillage, prized, renown, shadow (X), stealth, and terminal.\\n        \\n\\nRelated:\\nAmbush,\\n        Assault,\\n        Bestow,\\n        Insight,\\n        Intimidate,\\n        Limited,\\n        No Attachments,\\n        Pillage,\\n        Prized,\\n        Renown,\\n        Shadows,\\n        Stealth,\\n        Terminal\\n\\nKill, Killed\\nCharacters can be killed by framework effects and by card abilities. When a character is killed, it leaves play\\n        and is placed faceup on top of its owner\\'s dead pile.\\nRelated: Dead Pile, Leaves Play, Save\\nKneel, Kneeling, Knelt\\nCards often kneel in order to attack, defend, or use certain card abilities. When a card is knelt, it is rotated\\n        90 degrees. A card in this latter state is considered kneeling.\\n\\n A kneeling card cannot kneel again until it is standing (typically by a game step or card ability).\\n\\nRelated: Stand, Standing\\nLasting Effects\\nSome card abilities create effects or conditions that affect the game state for a specified duration (such as\\n        \"until the end of the challenge\" or \"until the end of the phase\"). Such effects are known as lasting\\n        effects.\\n\\n A lasting effect persists beyond the resolution of the ability that created it, for the duration specified\\n            by the effect. The effect continues to affect the game state for the specified duration regardless of\\n            whether the card that created the lasting effect is or remains in play.\\n        \\n A lasting effect expires as soon as the timing point specified by its duration is reached. This means that\\n            an \"until the end of the round\" lasting effect expires just before an \"at the end of the round\" ability may\\n            initiate.\\n        \\n Any \"until the end of the X\" effects that would initiate after the end of X (via the resolution of an\\n            interrupt or reaction ability to something that occurred at the end of X) would expire immediately without\\n            affecting the game state, and therefore fail to initiate.\\n        \\n\\nLeaves Play\\nThe phrase \"leaves play\" refers to any time a card makes a transition from an in play state to an out of play\\n        state.\\nIf a card leaves play, the following consequences occur simultaneously with the card leaving play:\\n\\n All tokens on the card are returned to the treasury.\\n All duplicates on the card are discarded.\\n All attachments that are on the card are returned to their owners\\' hands.\\n All lasting effects and/or delayed effects affecting the card while it is in play expire for that card.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: In Play and Out of Play\\nLimited\\nLimited is a keyword ability. No more than 1 card in total with the limited keyword can be marshaled (or played,\\n        if the card is an event) by each player each round. No more than 1 limited card can be placed by each player\\n        during setup.\\n\\n Limited cards that are \"put into play\" via card effects ignore and are ignored by this restriction.\\n\\nRelated: Keywords, Put into Play\\nLimits and Maxima\\n\"Limit X per [period]\" is a limit that appears on cards that remain in play through the resolution of an\\n        ability\\'s effect. Each copy of an ability with such a limit may be used X times during the designated period. If\\n        a card leaves play and re-enters play during the same period, the card is considered to be bringing a new copy\\n        of the ability to the game.\\n\"Limit X copies per [card/game element]\" is a limit that appears on attachment cards, and restricts the number of\\n        copies of that card (by title) that can be attached to each designated card or game element.\\n\"Max X per [period]\" is a maximum that appears on cards that do not enter or remain in play through the\\n        resolution of their effect. (An event card, for example.) Such a phrase imposes a maximum number of times that\\n        ability can be initiated from all copies (by title) of cards bearing the ability (including itself), during the\\n        designated period. Initiating an ability on a card counts towards the maximum for all copies of that card.\\n\\n All limits and maxima are player specific.\\n If the effects of a card or ability with a limit or a maximum are canceled, it is still counted against the\\n            limit/maximum.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Deck Limits, Plot Deck Limits\\n\\nLocation Cards\\nLocation cards represent the castles, cities, forests, shops, taverns, brothels, streets, and other places one\\n        might discover in the A Song of Ice and Fire setting. These cards enter play in the back row of a\\n        player\\'s play area and remain in play unless removed by an ability.\\nLook\\nWhen a player is instructed to \"look\" at one or more cards, that player does not show the cards to his or her\\n        opponents. A card is not considered to leave its play area while it is being looked at. A look instruction ends\\n        when a card is returned to its prior state of concealment, or reaches a new destination.\\nLoyal, Loyalty\\nLoyalty is a deckbuilding restriction that limits which cards can be used out-of-faction. A card is loyal to its\\n        faction if it has a scroll of parchment below its shield. A loyal card\\'s affiliation must match the affiliation\\n        of a deck\\'s faction card in order to be included in the deck. Certain card abilities (such as the Banner\\n        agenda cards) permit players to use non-loyal cards out-of-faction in a deck.\\nRelated: Deckbuilding\\nMarshal\\nIn the Marshaling phase, the active player can (as a player action) marshal a character, location, or attachment\\n        card (or a duplicate) from his or her hand by paying that card\\'s gold cost and placing the card in his or her\\n        play area. A player pays a gold cost by returning the indicated amount of gold from his or her gold pool to the\\n        treasury.\\n\\n When a card is marshaled, it is considered to have entered play.\\n Event cards are not marshaled, they are played.\\n Card abilities that put a card directly into play are not considered to be marshaling the card.\\n\\nRelated: Costs, Duplicates, Enters Play, Event Cards, Initiating Abilities/Marshaling Cards, Put into Play\\nMarshaling Phase\\nSee Appendix I, \"3.

The chosen characters are all killed simultaneously.\\nIf the player controls fewer characters than would satisfy claim, as much of the claim as possible must be\\n        satisfied.\\n\\n The same character cannot be chosen more than once to satisfy claim for a single [military] challenge.\\n If a character chosen to be killed for military claim is saved, the choice still serves to satisfy the\\n            claim.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Challenges Phase, Save\\nModifiers\\nSome abilities may ask players to modify values. The game state constantly checks and (if necessary) updates the\\n        count of any variable quantity that is being modified.\\nAny time a new modifier is applied (or removed), the entire quantity is recalculated from the start, considering\\n        the unmodified base value and all active modifiers.\\n\\n The calculation of a value should treat all modifiers as being applied simultaneously. However, while\\n            performing the calculation, all additive and subtractive modifiers should be calculated before doubling\\n            and/or halving modifiers are calculated.\\n        \\n Fractional values are rounded up after all modifiers have been applied.\\n When a value is \"set\" to a specific number, the set modifier overrides all non-set modifiers (including any\\n            new non-set modifiers that are added during the duration of the set value). If multiple set modifiers are in\\n            conflict, the most recently applied set modifier takes precedence.\\n        \\n A quantity cannot be reduced so that it functions with a value below zero: a card cannot have \"negative\"\\n            icons, STR, traits, cost, or keywords. Negative modifiers in excess of a value\\'s current quantity can be\\n            applied, but, after all active modifiers have been applied, any resultant value below zero is treated as\\n            zero.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Base Value\\nMove\\nSome effects allow players to move cards or tokens.\\n\\n When an entity moves, it cannot move to its same (current) placement.

Power that\\n        is moved is not considered \"gained.\"\\n\\n Power that is moved to a card under a different player\\'s control counts toward that player\\'s victory\\n            condition.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Gains, Power Claim\\nMulligan\\nAfter a player draws a starting hand during setup (but before placing any cards in setup), that player has a\\n        one-time option to declare a mulligan draw. After doing so, the player reshuffles his or her starting hand into\\n        his or her deck and draws a new starting hand of 7 cards. The player must keep this second hand.\\n\\n Players decide in player order whether or not to take a mulligan.\\n\\nRelated: Setup\\nNegative Quantities\\nSee \"Modifiers\".\\nNested Ability Sequences\\nEach time a triggering condition occurs, the following sequence is followed: (1) execute any interrupts to that\\n        triggering condition, (2) resolve the triggering condition, and then (3) execute any reactions to that\\n        triggering condition.\\nWithin this sequence, if an interrupt or a reaction to the original triggering condition generates a new\\n        triggering condition, the game pauses and starts a new sequence: (1) execute interrupts to the new triggering\\n        condition, (2) resolve the new triggering condition, and then (3) execute reactions to the new triggering\\n        condition. Once this nested sequence is fully completed, the game returns to where it left off, continuing with\\n        the original triggering condition\\'s sequence.\\nIt is possible that a nested sequence generates further triggering conditions (and hence more nested sequences).\\n        There is no limit to the number of nested sequences that may occur, but each nested sequence must complete\\n        before returning to the sequence that spawned it. In effect, these sequences are resolved in a Last In, First\\n        Out (LIFO) manner.\\nIn each interrupt window and each reaction window, nested or not, the first player always has the first\\n        opportunity to initiate an interrupt or reaction (respectively).\\nRelated: Interrupts, Reactions\\nNeutral\\nSome cards are not affiliated with any faction; these cards are neutral. Any deck may include neutral cards.\\n\\n Neutral cards are not considered to be in-faction or out-of-faction.\\n\\nRelated: Deckbuilding, Faction\\nNext Player\\nSee \"Player Order\".\\nNo Attachments\\nNo attachments is a keyword ability. A card with this keyword cannot have an attachment card attached.\\n\\n If one or more traits precedes the word \"attachments,\" the card cannot have an attachment that possesses\\n            one of the specified traits, but it can have attachments possessing none of those traits.\\n        \\n If the word \"attachments\" is followed by the word \"except\" and one or more traits, the card can have\\n            attachments that possess one or more of the specified traits, but it cannot have attachments possessing none\\n            of those traits.\\n        \\n If a card has multiple variants of the \"no attachments\" keyword, any variant that would prevent a card from\\n            having a given attachment prevails.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Attachment Cards, Keywords, Traits\\nOut of Play\\nSee \"In Play and Out of Play\".\\nOwnership and Control\\nA card\\'s owner is the player whose deck held the card at the start of the game.\\n\\n Cards by default enter play under their owner\\'s control. Some abilities may cause cards to change control\\n            during a game.\\n        \\n A player controls the cards located in his or her out of play game areas (such as the hand, deck, discard\\n            pile, and dead pile).\\n        \\n If a card would enter an out of play area of a player who does not own the card, the card is placed in its\\n            owner\\'s equivalent out of play area instead. (For all associated card ability and framework effect purposes,\\n            the card is considered to have entered that opponent\\'s out of play area, and only the physical placement of\\n            the card is adjusted.)\\n        \\n If a participating character changes control during the resolution of a challenge, it is immediately\\n            removed from the challenge.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Deck, Leaves Play\\nParticipating\\nAny character that has been declared as an attacker or as a defender for a challenge is considered participating\\n        in that challenge through the resolution of the challenge.\\n\\n A character is either participating or not participating in a challenge.\\n If an ability explicitly removes a character from a challenge, that character is no longer participating in\\n            the challenge.\\n        \\n If a participating character leaves play for any reason, it is no longer participating in the challenge.\\n        \\n Once a character is participating in a challenge, losing the challenge icon of that type does not\\n            remove the character from the challenge.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Attacker, Challenges Phase, Defender\\nPass\\nThere are numerous points in the game where a player has an option between performing an act (such as taking an\\n        action, triggering an ability, or executing a game step) or passing. Passing in such a situation forfeits the\\n        player\\'s right to perform that act at that moment.\\n\\n Many game sequences continue until all players pass consecutively. Should one player perform the function\\n            (i.e., not pass) during his or her opportunity, opportunities to perform or pass continue clockwise in\\n            player order until a state of consecutive passes by all players is achieved. Passing an opportunity does not\\n            prevent a player from acting during his or her next opportunity in the same sequence, as long as a state of\\n            consecutive passes by all players does not occur.\\n        \\n\\nPillage\\nPillage is a challenge resolution keyword. After a player wins a challenge, for each participating character with\\n        the pillage keyword he or she controls, that player may discard 1 card from the top of the losing opponent\\'s\\n        deck.\\nRelated: Challenges Phase, Keywords\\nPlay Restrictions and Permissions\\nMany cards or abilities contain specific instructions pertaining to when or how they may or may not be used, or\\n        to specific conditions that must be true in order to use them. In order to use such an ability or play/marshal\\n        such a card, these play restrictions must be observed. A permission is an optional play restriction, which\\n        allows a player to play/marshal a card or use an ability outside the timing or specifications provided by the\\n        game rules.\\nRelated: Event Cards, Initiating Abilities / Marshaling Cards\\nPlayer Order\\nIf the players are instructed to perform a sequence in \"player order,\" the first player performs his or her part\\n        of the sequence first, followed by the other players in clockwise order. The phrase \"the next player\" is used in\\n        this context to refer to the next player (clockwise) to act in player order.\\nRelated: First Player\\nPlot Card\\nPlot cards represent the round-by-round strategic decisions and plans a player makes throughout the course of a\\n        game. A player\\'s plot deck begins the game with exactly seven plot cards. Each plot card possesses a gold,\\n        initiative, claim, and reserve value. Many plot cards also possess an ability.\\n\\n Each plot card exists in one of three states: in the plot deck, revealed, or in the used pile.\\n When a player reveals a new plot card, it leaves the plot deck and enters the revealed state. Place it on\\n            top of that player\\'s previously revealed plot card. This removes the previously revealed plot card from\\n            play, and replaces it with the newly revealed plot card. All plot cards under a player\\'s currently revealed\\n            plot card are considered that player\\'s used pile.\\n        \\n A player\\'s revealed plot card is considered in play and interacts with the game state.\\n When a player reveals the final card of his or her plot deck, after all just revealed plot cards have\\n            entered play and all necessary \"When Revealed\" abilities have resolved, each plot card in that player\\'s used\\n            pile is returned to his or her plot deck.

No more than one copy of each of\\n        the other plot cards may be included in the plot deck.\\nRelated: Deckbuilding, Plot Card, Plot Deck Limit: X\\nPlot Deck Limit: X\\nIf a plot card bears the phrase, \"Plot Deck Limit: X,\" no more than X copies (by title) of the plot card may be\\n        included in a plot deck.\\n\\n If X is 1, this phrase acts as a deckbuilding restriction. A player cannot include an additional copy of\\n            this plot card in his or her plot deck.\\n        \\n If X is 3 or higher, this phrase acts as a deckbuilding permission. A player may include up to X copies of\\n            this plot card in his or her plot deck, should this plot card be selected by the player as the one card for\\n            which additional copies are permitted.\\n        \\n\\nPlot Phase\\nSee Appendix I, \"1.

A player\\'s power total is equal to the amount\\n        of power amassed on cards under his or her control, and is tracked using power counters.\\nRelated: Winning the Game\\nPower Claim\\nWhen a player loses a power ([power]) challenge as the defending player, that player must remove a number of\\n        power from his or her faction card equal to the claim value on the attacking player\\'s revealed plot card, and\\n        move it to the attacking player\\'s faction card.\\nIf the player controls less power than would satisfy claim, as much of the claim as possible must be\\n        satisfied.\\nRelated: Challenges Phase\\nPrinted\\nThe word \"printed\" refers to the text, characteristic, icon, or value that is physically printed on the card.\\nRelated: Blank\\nPriority of Simultaneous Resolution\\nIf a single effect affects multiple players simultaneously, but the players must individually make choices to\\n        resolve the effect, the first player chooses first, followed by the other players in player order. Once all\\n        necessary choices have been made, the effect resolves simultaneously upon all affected entities.\\n\\n If the resolution of two or more when revealed abilities, delayed effects, or forced abilities would\\n            resolve at the same time, the first player decides the order in which the abilities resolve, regardless of\\n            who controls the cards bearing the conflicting abilities.\\n        \\n If two or more constant abilities and/or lasting effects cannot be applied simultaneously, the first player\\n            determines the order in which the constant abilities are applied.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: First Player\\nPrized\\nPrized is a keyword ability. When a character, location, or attachment with the prized (X) keyword would leave\\n        play, each opponent of that card\\'s controller gains X power for his or her faction. This occurs immediately upon\\n        the card leaving play, after resolving any interrupts to the card leaving play, but prior to triggering any\\n        reactions to the card leaving play.\\nWhen an event with the prized (X) keyword is played, each opponent of the player who plays the event gains X\\n        power for his or her faction. This occurs immediately upon the event being played, prior to initiating its\\n        effects.\\nWhen a plot with the prized (X) keyword is placed in the used pile, each opponent of that plot\\'s controller gains\\n        X power for his or her faction.\\nIf a card has multiple instances of the prized (X) keyword, those instances are cumulative.\\nRelated: Keywords\\nPut into Play\\nSome card abilities may cause a card to be \"put into play.\" Such abilities place the card directly into play from\\n        an out of play state.\\n\\n The gold cost of the card being \"put into play\" is not paid.\\n Unless otherwise instructed by the \"put into play\" effect, cards that enter play in this manner must do so\\n            in a play area or attachment state that satisfies the rules of marshaling the card.\\n        \\n A card that has been put into play is not considered to have been \"marshaled.\"\\n If an additional copy of a unique card a player already owns and controls is put into play under his or her\\n            control, it enters play as a duplicate.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Dead Pile, Duplicates, In Play and Out of Play, Marshal, Unique Cards\\nQualifiers\\nIf card text includes a qualifier followed by multiple terms, the qualifier applies to each item in the list, if\\n        it is applicable. For example, in the phrase \"each unique character and location,\" the word \"unique\" applies\\n        both to \"character\" and to \"location.\"\\nReactions\\nA reaction is a triggered ability whose text contains the boldface \"Reaction:\" precursor. Always\\n        resolve a triggering condition before initiating any reactions to that triggering condition.\\nUnlike actions, which are resolved during action windows, each reaction may be initiated once each time\\n        its specified triggering condition occurs, as described in the reaction\\'s ability text.\\nAfter a triggering condition resolves, a reaction window for that triggering condition opens.\\nWithin the reaction window, the first player always has the first opportunity to initiate an eligible reaction\\n        (to this triggering condition), or pass. Opportunities to initiate an eligible reaction, or pass, continue in\\n        player order until all players consecutively pass, at which point the reaction window closes. Passing does not\\n        prevent a player from initiating an eligible reaction later in that same reaction window.\\nOnce a reaction window closes, further reactions to that specific triggering condition cannot be initiated.\\n\\n It is possible for multiple reactions to be initiated from the same triggering condition. Each reaction\\n            must resolve completely before the next reaction to the same triggering condition may initiate.\\n        \\n If multiple copies of the same reaction are eligible to be initiated, each copy may be initiated once\\n            against that triggering condition. Each eligible reaction may be used once per trigger. (If multiple copies\\n            of the same reaction are eligible, each copy may be used once.)\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Interrupts, Nested\\n            Ability Sequences\\nRedirect (Melee game only)\\nThe Crown Regent title card can be used to redirect a single challenge each round. This ability is used after a\\n        challenge is initiated, before any reactions to that challenge\\'s initiation can be triggered.\\nIf a challenge is redirected, the player who is initiating the challenge must immediately choose a new opponent\\n        to resolve the challenge against. The attacking player may also choose new stealth targets (controlled by the\\n        new defending player) if he or she desires. Any originally declared stealth targets are not considered to have\\n        been bypassed by stealth; any new targets are.\\nThe challenge is still considered to have been initiated against the original opponent, but it resolves against\\n        the new opponent.\\nA redirected challenge may not be resolved against the same opponent it was originally initiated against.\\nAny effect that would prevent a challenge from being initiated against a player does not prevent a redirected\\n        challenge from resolving against that player. (This means that a redirected challenge may resolve against an\\n        opponent the attacking player supports.)\\nThe player initiating the challenge cannot change which characters he or she has declared, or the challenge type\\n        that has been announced, when a challenge has been redirected.\\nRelated: Melee Game\\nRemoved from Game\\nA card that has been removed from the game is set aside and has no further interaction with the game in any\\n        manner for the duration of its removal.\\nIf there is no specified duration, a card that has been removed from the game is considered removed until the end\\n        of the game.\\nRelated: In Play and Out of Play\\nRenown\\nRenown is a challenge resolution keyword. After a player wins a challenge, each participating character with the\\n        renown keyword he or she controls may gain 1 power.\\nRelated: Challenges Phase, Keywords\\nReplacement Effects\\nA replacement effect is an effect (usually an interrupt) that replaces the resolution of a triggering condition\\n        with a different means of resolving that same triggering condition, but in such a manner that the triggering\\n        condition is still considered to occur. The word \"instead\" is frequently indicative of a such an effect. After\\n        all interrupts to the triggering condition have resolved and it is time to resolve the triggering condition\\n        itself, the replacement effect resolves instead.\\nIf multiple replacement effects are initiated against the same triggering condition, the most recent replacement\\n        effect is the one that is used for the resolution of the triggering condition.\\nFor example, Benjen Stark has the following replacement effect, \"Interrupt: When Benjen\\n            Stark is killed, gain 2 power for your faction. Then, shuffle him back into your deck instead of placing him\\n            in your dead pile.\" The triggering condition (i.e. the killing of Benjen Stark) will still occur, but the\\n            triggering condition will resolve differently from normal because the card will be shuffled back into its\\n            owner\\'s deck rather than being placed in its owner\\'s dead pile.\\nRelated: Interrupts\\nReserve Value\\nEach plot card has a reserve value. During the taxation phase, each player compares his or her current hand size\\n        (i.e., the number of cards in the player\\'s hand) with the reserve value on his or her currently revealed plot\\n        (which incorporates all relevant reserve modifiers). If a player\\'s hand size is higher than his or her reserve\\n        value, that player must choose and discard cards from his or her hand until the hand size is equal to the\\n        reserve value. All players perform this process in player order.\\nRelated: Plot Value Modifiers\\nReserve Modifier\\nSee \"Plot Value Modifiers\".\\nReveal\\nWhen a player is instructed to reveal cards, that player is obliged to show those cards to his or her opponents.\\n        If there is no specified duration for the reveal, the revealed cards remain revealed until they reach a new\\n        destination (as specified by the ability), or through the completion of the ability\\'s resolution.\\n\\n While it is revealed, a revealed card is still considered to be located in the game area (such as a\\n            player\\'s hand or deck) from which it is revealed.\\n        \\n\\nRevealed Plot\\nSee \"Plot Card\".\\nRivals (Melee game only)\\nIf a player\\'s title card lists another title as a \"rival,\" that player gains 1 power for his or her faction after\\n        winning a challenge against an opponent who bears that rival title. This occurs during framework step 4.2.3 (see\\n        Appendix I) and is known as a rivals bonus.\\n\\n A player can gain a maximum of 1 rivals bonus per rival opponent by winning a challenge against that\\n            opponent each round.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Melee Game, Title Cards\\nSacrifice\\nWhen a player is instructed to sacrifice a card, that player must choose a card in play that he or she controls\\n        and that matches the requirements of the sacrifice, and place it in his or her discard pile.\\n\\n If the chosen card does not leave play, the sacrifice is not considered to have been made.\\n Sacrificing a card does not satisfy any other means (such as \"kill\" or \"discard\") of a card leaving play.\\n        \\n A sacrificed card cannot be saved.\\n\\nRelated: Ownership and Control, Save\\n\\nSave\\nWhen a card is saved from an effect that attempts to remove that card from play, the card remains in play as the\\n        effect resolves and is not considered to have been killed, discarded, or otherwise removed from play by the\\n        effect.\\n\\n If a card is saved from [military] claim, the card was still chosen for [military] claim, and therefore is\\n            still counted towards the fulfillment of the claim.\\n        \\n If an aspect of an ability that removes a card from play is followed by the text \"cannot be saved,\" players\\n            cannot attempt to save that card.\\n        \\n If a constant ability or lasting effect imposes a condition upon a card that would continually drive it\\n            from play (for example, a lasting effect that applies to a character over a period of time, and kills\\n                that character if its STR is 0), any attempt to save the card must also remedy the ongoing\\n            condition. Otherwise, upon resolution of the save attempt, the card is immediately re-exposed to the ongoing\\n            condition, and removed from play. Therefore, if the save effect does not also remedy the ongoing condition,\\n            it cannot be initiated, as the effect has no potential to change the game state.

A card with shadow (X) can be marshaled facedown into its controller\\'s shadows area for 2 gold. That card can later be played (if it is an event) or brought into play faceup (if it is a character, location, or attachment) by paying X gold.\\nIn addition to the presence of the shadow keyword in the text box, cards with the shadow keyword can be easily identified by the presence of a banner around the card\\'s gold cost.\\nMarshaling a card into shadows\\nDuring the marshaling phase, the active player may, as a player action, pay 2 gold to marshal a card with the shadow keyword into shadows from his or her hand. A card marshaled into shadows is placed facedown in an area clearly separate from other game areas. There is no limit to the number of cards that a player can marshal into shadows during the marshaling phase.\\nMarshaling a card into shadows is not considered to be \"playing\" a card. Marshaling a card into shadows is not considered to be marshaling a card with any of that card\\'s characteristics; it is only considered to be \"marshaling a card into shadows.\"\\nCards without the shadow keyword cannot be marshaled into shadows. However, such cards may be placed into shadows by card effects. If a card is placed into shadows by a card effect, that card is placed facedown in its controller\\'s shadows area. An effect that causes a card to \"return\" to shadows will place that card into shadows, even if that card did not enter play from shadows.\\nDuring setup, cards with the shadow keyword (including events) may be placed into shadows by spending 2 gold from the amount allocated for setup for each card. When setup cards are revealed, any cards that were placed into shadows remain facedown in their controller\\'s shadows area.\\nWhile a card is in shadows\\nShadows is a distinct out-of-play area; cards in shadows are not considered to be \"in play\" nor \"in hand.\"\\nEach card in shadows is facedown, and remains facedown while it is in shadows. A player may look at any card he or she controls in shadows, at any time. A player may not look at any opponent\\'s card in shadows.\\nIf a player has multiple cards in shadows, that player must ensure that those cards can be easily differentiated from one another. A player cannot shuffle or rearrange his or her cards in shadows in a way that disguises the identity of those cards.\\nEach player\\'s shadows area should be visually separate from their other game areas, and from each other player\\'s.\\nSome effects may place one or more tokens on a card in shadows. If a card transitions from shadows to any other game area, all tokens on that card are discarded.\\nBringing a card out of shadows\\nA card\\'s \"shadow cost\" is the value listed in parentheses after the shadow keyword. For instance, a card with the text \"Shadow (4)\" has a shadow cost of 4. Any effect that modifies the cost to bring a card out of shadows modifies that card\\'s shadow cost.\\nAs an action, a player may bring a character, location, or attachment out of shadows and into play by paying its shadow cost (e.g. paying 4 gold to bring a \"Shadow (4)\" card into play). A card that is brought out of shadows and into play is considered to be entering play using a card ability; it is not considered to have been \"marshaled\" or \"played.\"\\nAn attachment that is brought out of shadows must immediately be attached to an eligible card. If there are no eligible cards to attach to, the attachment is discarded without entering play.\\nAn event in shadows may be played by paying its shadow cost whenever its triggering condition and/or play conditions are met, as if a player were playing it from his or her hand.\\nIf a card has multiple instances of the shadow keyword, each with a different (X) value, the player controlling the card may choose which instance of the shadow keyword is used to bring the card out of shadows.\\nSome effects allow a card to be \"put into play\" from shadows. Such abilities place the card directly into play from its controller\\'s shadows area. The shadow cost of a card being \"put into play\" is not paid. An event card cannot be put into play by such an effect.\\nA character, location, or attachment is considered to \"come out of shadows\" if it enters play from shadows. An event is considered to \"come out of shadows\" if it is played from shadows.\\nPrinted cost of shadows cards\\nMany cards with the shadow keyword also have a standard printed cost, in the upper left corner of the card. Any reference to a card\\'s \"printed cost\" refers to this value. Such a card may be marshaled or played from a player\\'s hand by paying its printed cost, following standard game rules.\\nDuring setup, such a card may either be placed as normal for its printed cost, or placed into shadows for 2 gold. While such a card is in shadows, it may be brought out of shadows only by paying its shadow cost.\\nSome cards with the shadow keyword have a \"-\" in place of their printed cost. Such a card cannot be marshaled or played from a player\\'s hand, and may only be played by being brought out of shadows. Such a card has no printed cost. If an ability references the printed cost of that card, a null value is returned.\\nUnique cards and shadows\\nA unique card may be marshaled into shadows even if its owner already has a copy of that card in play or in his or her dead pile.\\nA player may bring a unique card out of shadows by paying its shadow cost even if he or she owns and controls another copy of that unique card in play. However, the card will enter play as a duplicate.\\nBringing a unique card out of shadows is subject to the same restrictions as any other attempt to put a unique card into play. If a unique card is unable to enter play legally, it may not be brought out of shadows.\\nStand, Standing\\nA card that is in an upright state so that its controller can read its text from left to right is considered\\n        standing.\\n\\n The default state in which cards enter play is standing.\\n A standing card is knelt by rotating it 90 degrees to the side.\\n\\nRelated: Enters Play, Kneel, Kneeling\\nStanding Phase\\nSee Appendix I, \"6. Standing phase\".\\nStealth\\nStealth is a keyword ability. When a player initiates a challenge, for each character with stealth he or she\\n        declares as an attacker, that player may choose one character without stealth controlled by the defending\\n        player. Each chosen character is considered bypassed by stealth, and cannot be declared as a defender for that\\n        challenge.\\nRelated: Challenges Phase, Keywords\\nSTR\\nThe abbreviation for \"strength.\"\\nStrength, Strength Modifiers\\nA character\\'s strength (abbreviated \"STR\") represents its effectiveness in challenges. The higher the STR, the\\n        more effective the character. A character\\'s printed STR can be found in the shield to the left of its title.\\nTotal attacking STR is the sum of each participating character\\'s STR on the attacking player\\'s side, plus any\\n        relevant modifiers.\\nTotal defending STR is the sum of each participating character\\'s STR on the defending player\\'s side, plus any\\n        relevant modifiers.\\nA player is not able to win a challenge with a total attacking or defending STR of zero.\\nRelated: Challenges Phase\\nSupports (Melee game only)\\nIf a player\\'s melee title card \"supports\" another title, the bearer of that title cannot initiate a challenge\\n        against the bearer of the title he or she supports.\\nRelated: Title Cards\\nSwitch\\nSome abilities use the word \"switch.\" In order to resolve such an ability, switched items must exist on each side\\n        of the switch.\\nTarget\\nThe term \"choose\" indicates that a target must be chosen in order for an ability to resolve. The player resolving\\n        the effect must choose a game element (usually a card) that meets the targeting requirements of the ability.\\n\\n The controller of a targeting ability chooses all targets for the effect unless otherwise specified by the\\n            card.\\n        \\n If an ability requires the choosing of a target (or targets), and there is no valid target (or not enough\\n            valid targets), then the ability cannot be initiated. This initiation check is made at the same time the\\n            ability\\'s play restrictions are checked.\\n        \\n\\nAt the time targets are chosen, any currently valid targets are eligible to be chosen. (This choice is not restricted only to targets that were present during the initiation check.) Overruled by FAQ (3.2).\\n        \\n If multiple targets are required to be chosen by the same player, these are chosen simultaneously.\\n An effect that can choose \"any number\" of targets does not successfully resolve (and cannot change the game\\n            state) if zero of those targets are chosen.\\n        \\n The resolution of some effects (such as post-then effects, or delayed effects) requires that targets are\\n            chosen after the initiation of the effect. Such targets need not be verified when checking play restrictions\\n            and determining whether or not the entire ability may initiate. If there are no valid targets at the time\\n            such targets would be chosen, that aspect of the effect fails to resolve.\\n        \\n A card is not an eligible target for an ability if the resolution of that ability\\'s effect could not affect\\n            the target at all. (For example, a kneeling character cannot be chosen as the target for an effect that\\n                reads, \"choose and kneel a character.\")\\n\\nRelated: Delayed Effects, Initiating Abilities, The\\n            word \"Then\"\\nTaxation Phase\\nSee Appendix I, \"7. Taxation phase\".\\nTerminal\\nTerminal is a keyword ability that appears on attachment cards. If the card or game element to which a terminal\\n        card is attached leaves play, the attachment does not return to its owner\\'s hand, and is discarded from\\n        play.\\nRelated: Attachment Cards, Keywords\\nThe word \"Then\"\\nIf the effect text of an ability includes the word \"then,\" the text preceding the word \"then\" must be\\n        successfully resolved in full (i.e. the game state changes to reflect the intent of the pre-then aspect of the\\n        effect in its entirety) before the remainder of the effect described after the word \"then\" can be resolved.\\n\\n If the pre-then aspect of an effect does successfully resolve in full, the resolution of the post-then\\n            aspect of the effect must also attempt to resolve.\\n        \\n If the pre-then aspect of an effect does not successfully resolve in full, the post-then aspect does not\\n            attempt to resolve.\\n        \\n\\nTitle Cards, Title Pool (Melee game only)\\nThe title cards are used only in the melee game. Each title provides unique capabilities to its bearer, and\\n        fosters political relationships among the players.\\nThe title pool is created during game setup. It contains all of the title cards not currently controlled by a\\n        player. Players select a title from the title pool each round during the plot phase, and bear it throughout the\\n        round. While a player bears a title, it is in play under his or her control.\\nIn addition to creating rival and support relationships among the players (and to the textual or iconic abilities\\n        described on the cards), each of the following titles also provides its bearer with a unique STR bonus for a\\n        specified part of the round.\\nThe Crown Regent contributes 2 additional STR to its bearer\\'s total for dominance.\\nThe Hand of the King contributes 1 additional STR to its bearer\\'s total during any [power]\\n        challenge in which he or she controls a participating character.\\nThe Master of Ships contributes 1 additional STR to its bearer\\'s total during any [military]\\n        challenge in which he or she controls a participating character.\\nThe Master of Whispers contributes 1 additional STR to its bearer\\'s total during any [intrigue]\\n        challenge in which he or she controls a participating character.\\n\\n If a player\\'s title card leaves play, it must be returned to the title pool.\\n\\nRelated: Melee Game, Plot Phase, Redirect, Rivals, Supports\\nTokens, Running out of\\nThere is no limit to the number of gold, power, or influence tokens which can be in the play area at a given\\n        time. If players run out of the provided tokens, other tokens, counters, or coins may be used to track the\\n        current game state.\\nTraits\\nMost cards have one or more traits listed at the top of the text box and printed in bold italics.\\n    \\n\\n Traits have no inherent effect on the game. Instead, some card abilities reference cards that possess\\n            specific traits.\\n        \\n\\nTreasury\\nThe treasury is created during game setup and contains all of the tokens and counters not currently controlled by\\n        any player.\\n\\n When a player gains gold, that gold is taken from the treasury and added to the player\\'s gold pool. When a\\n            player spends gold to marshal a card or pay for an ability, that gold is returned to the treasury.\\n        \\n When a card with any tokens or counters on it leaves play, those tokens or counters are returned to the\\n            treasury.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Setup, Gold, Influence\\n            Tokens, Power\\nTriggered Abilities\\nA triggered ability is any ability with a boldface precursor followed by a colon and the rest of the ability.\\n        This includes actions, phase specific actions, interrupts, reactions, forced interrupts or reactions, and when\\n        revealed abilities.\\nRelated: Abilities, Triggering\\n            Condition\\nTriggering Condition\\nA triggering condition is a specific occurrence that takes place in the game. On card abilities, the triggering\\n        condition is the element of the ability that references such an occurrence, indicating the timing point at which\\n        the ability may be used. The description of an ability\\'s triggering condition often follows the word \"when\" (for\\n        interrupt abilities) or the word \"after\" (for reaction abilities).\\nIf a single occurrence creates multiple triggering conditions (such as two characters being killed simultaneously\\n        by a claim 2 military challenge), those triggering conditions are handled in shared interrupt/ reaction windows,\\n        in which abilities that refer to any of the triggering conditions created by that occurrence may be used.\\nThe following is a sequence of possible interrupt and reaction opportunities that exists around each triggering\\n        condition that may arise in a game:\\n\\n The triggering condition becomes imminent. (In other words, if it is not canceled, changed, or otherwise\\n            pre-empted by interrupt abilities, the triggering condition is the next thing that will occur in the game.)\\n        \\n Interrupt abilities referencing when the imminent triggering condition \"would\" occur may be used. (Note\\n            that for effects, a \"cancel\" interrupt may prevent the effect from initiating, and that the initiation of an\\n            effect is a separate triggering condition, that comes before the resolution of the effect. \"Cancel\"\\n            interrupts are the only type that will reference the initiation of an effect.) If the imminent triggering\\n            condition is canceled, none of the subsequent steps in this sequence occur. If the triggering condition is\\n            changed, the original triggering condition is no longer imminent, but the newly established triggering\\n            condition is now imminent (usually, this will mean that a card that was about to leave play is now about to\\n            be saved).\\n        \\n Forced interrupts to the imminent triggering condition must resolve, in the order determined by the first\\n            player.\\n        \\n The interrupt window to the imminent triggering condition opens, and closes after all players consecutively\\n            pass.\\n        \\n The triggering condition itself occurs.\\n Forced reactions to the triggering condition must resolve, in the order determined by the first player.\\n        \\n The reaction window to the triggering condition opens, and closes after all players consecutively pass.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Cancel, Initiating\\n            Abilities, Interrupts, Reactions, The word \"Would\"\\nUnique Cards\\nA card with the [unique] symbol before its card title is a \"unique\" card. Each player may only own or control a\\n        maximum of one instance of each unique card, by title, in play.\\n\\n A player may marshal (or put into play by a card ability) additional copies of each unique card he or she\\n            owns and controls, placed as a duplicate on that card, for no cost.\\n        \\n A player cannot take control of a unique card if he or she already controls or owns an in-play copy of that\\n            card.\\n        \\n A player cannot bring into play or take control of a unique card if a copy of that card is in his or her\\n            dead pile.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Dead Pile, Duplicates, Ownership and Control\\nUnopposed, Unopposed Challenge\\nA challenge is \"unopposed\" if the defending player counts 0 STR when the challenge winner is determined. This can\\n        occur if the defending player controls no participating characters, or if there are defending characters but the\\n        total defending STR is 0.\\n\\n When a player wins an unopposed challenge as the attacker, that player gains 1 power for his or her faction\\n            card. This occurs during framework step 4.2.3 (see Appendix I), and is known as an\\n            unopposed bonus.\\n        \\n\\nUsed Pile\\nSee \"Plot Card\".\\nWhen Revealed\\nA When Revealed ability contains the boldface \"When Revealed:\" precursor. Such an ability must\\n        resolve whenever a plot card bearing it is revealed.\\nSee timing step \"1.3 Reveal plots\".\\nWinning a Challenge\\nEach challenge is won by the player who counts the highest total STR for his or her side when the challenge\\n        result is determined.\\n\\n A player\\'s total STR is the sum of the STR of each participating character on his or her side of the\\n            challenge, along with any other modifiers that are affecting the amount of STR that player counts for that\\n            challenge.\\n        \\n A player must count at least 1 total STR and there must be at least 1 participating character on his or her\\n            side in order to win a challenge.\\n        \\n If the total STR counted on each side is tied at a value of 1 or greater (and the attacker controls at\\n            least 1 participating character), the attacker wins the challenge.\\n        \\n If neither player can meet the requirements of winning a challenge, neither player wins (or loses) that\\n            challenge.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Challenges Phase, Claim, Unopposed\\nWinning the Game\\nThe first player to have 15 (or more) power on cards he or she controls wins the game. The game ends immediately\\n        if a player meets the victory condition of having 15 (or more) power.\\n\\n If multiple players would reach this victory condition simultaneously, the first player determines which of\\n            those players wins the game.\\n        \\n A player is eliminated from the game when his or her draw deck has no cards remaining. If all of a player\\'s\\n            opponents are eliminated from the game, the remaining player wins the game.

This means that an interrupt\\n        with the word \"would\" (such as \"when a character would be killed\") has timing priority over an interrupt without\\n        the word \"would\" to the same occurrence (such as \"when a character is killed\").\\n\\n If an interrupt to a triggering condition that would occur changes the nature of that which is about to\\n            occur (such as saving a character that would be killed), no further interrupts to the original trigger may\\n            be used, as the resolution of that trigger is no longer imminent.\\n        \\n\\nRelated: Cancel, Interrupts, Replacement Effects, Save\\nThe letter \"X\"\\nUnless specified by a card ability or granted player choice, the letter X is always equal to 0.

Framework events are mandatory\\n        occurrences dictated by the structure of the game. Yellow windows are framework events that only occur when\\n        playing the melee format of the game. Grey windows are special framework events that indicate the possibility of\\n        the game returning to an earlier framework event in the chart. These repetitive sequences can end in various\\n        ways, such as when all players have performed the steps in the sequence, or when a player makes a specific\\n        decision. Each grey window explains when and how the game either loops back or progresses to a later framework\\n        event.\\nAction Windows\\nAn Action may only be initiated during an action window. Action windows are presented in red boxes on the chart.\\n        When an action window opens, the first player has the first opportunity to initiate an action, or pass.\\n        Opportunities to initiate actions rotate between the players in player order until all players consecutively\\n        pass, at which point the action window closes. (Note that if a player passes his or her opportunity to act, but\\n        the other opponents do not consecutively pass in sequence, the original player may still take an action when the\\n        rotation of action opportunities comes back around to the original player.)\\nResolve each action completely before the next action opportunity.\\nReactions and Interrupts\\nAn Interrupt or Reaction ability can interrupt or react to the resolution of a framework event if the triggering\\n        condition of the ability is met.\\nEach reaction or interrupt must resolve completely before the next interrupt or reaction to the same triggering\\n        condition may initiate.\\nFor example: An ability that reads, \"Reaction: After you win a challenge...\"\\n        initiates after step (4.2.2) of the challenge resolution framework event is complete.\\nTiming Sequence Chart\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFramework Event Details\\nThis section provides a detailed explanation on how to handle each framework event step presented on the game\\'s\\n        flow chart, in the order that the framework events occur throughout the round.\\n1. Plot phase\\n1.1 Plot phase begins\\nThis step formalizes the beginning of the plot phase. As this is the first framework event of the round, it also\\n        formalizes the beginning of a new game round.\\nThe beginning of a phase is an important game milestone that may be referenced in card text, either as a point at\\n        which an ability may or must resolve, or as a point at which a lasting effect or constant ability begins or\\n        expires.\\n1.2 Choose plots\\nEach player looks at the cards remaining in his or her plot deck, and chooses one to reveal during the next\\n        framework step. The chosen plot is placed facedown apart from the plot deck, and not revealed to other players\\n        during this step.\\nOnce each player has chosen a plot and placed it facedown away from his or her plot deck, this step is\\n        complete.\\n1.3 Reveal plots\\nThe players simultaneously reveal each of the plot cards that were chosen during step 1.2 by turning those cards\\n        faceup.\\nWhen a player\\'s plot card is revealed, it is placed on top of his or her previously revealed plot card. All plot\\n        cards beneath a player\\'s currently revealed plot card are considered that player\\'s \"used pile.\"\\nThe act of revealing plot cards for this framework event involves three steps, performed in this order:\\nI. Compare initiative. The player with the highest initiative value on his or her revealed plot\\n        card (which incorporates all relevant initiative modifiers) wins initiative. If multiple players have the same\\n        initiative value, the tied player with the lowest power total wins initiative. If the players\\' initiative and\\n        power totals are both tied, the tie is broken by randomly selecting one of the tied players.\\nII. Choose first player. The player who won initiative in step I chooses a player to be the\\n        first player. The chosen player takes the first player token and keeps it until another card or game effect\\n        (usually this step in the following round) selects a new first player.\\nNote: If a player reveals a new plot card outside the standard plot phase framework step (for\\n        instance, by resolving a card ability), steps I and II are skipped: there is no new initiative comparison or\\n        determination of a new first player.\\nIII. Initiate When Revealed abilities. Any when revealed abilities on plot cards that have just\\n        been revealed must now initiate. If multiple players have When revealed abilities on their plot cards, the first\\n        player determines the order in which these abilities initiate. Resolve each when revealed ability before\\n        initiating the next.\\nOnce these steps are complete, the players have completed the process of revealing plots. If a player has no\\n        cards in his or her plot deck, that player\\'s used pile now returns to his or her plot deck. (The just revealed\\n        plot is not yet in the used pile and does not return at this time.)\\nTIMING NOTE: Any reaction abilities that read \"After you reveal a plot card\" or \"After a player reveals a\\n            plot card\" may be initiated after the completion of the above step III.\\n1.4 Select titles (melee format only)\\nIf the players are playing a melee game, they now select titles for the round. In a joust game, this framework\\n        step is skipped.\\nFirst, shuffle the six titles facedown and remove one at random from the title pool. If three players are\\n        playing, remove two at random instead. If six or more players are playing, no titles are removed.\\nThe first player then looks at the remaining titles in the title pool, and takes one without revealing his or her\\n        selection to the other players. The remaining titles are passed in player order, with each player selecting one\\n        title in this manner. After all players have selected, any unselected titles (including the titles that were\\n        randomly removed at the beginning of this step) are returned facedown to the title pool, and each selected title\\n        is turned face up in front of the player who selected it. Each selected title enters play simultaneously, is\\n        considered in play under its bearer\\'s control, and may interact with the game state until it is returned to the\\n        title pool.\\nIf more than six players are playing in a melee game, any player who would be selecting a title from an empty\\n        title pool plays the round without a title.\\n1.5 Plot phase ends\\nThis step formalizes the end of the plot phase.\\nThe end of a phase is an important game milestone that may be referenced in card text, either as a point at which\\n        an ability may or must resolve, or as a point at which a lasting effect or constant ability expires or\\n        begins.\\n2. Draw phase\\n2.1 Draw phase begins\\nThis step formalizes the beginning of the draw phase.\\n2.2 Draw\\nEach player must simultaneously draw 2 cards from the top of his or her draw deck.\\nNote: A player is eliminated from the game immediately if there are no cards remaining in his or\\n        her deck. If all remaining players are eliminated while fulfilling this step, the first player determines which\\n        of those players is the winner of the game.\\n2.3 Draw phase ends\\nThis step formalizes the end of the draw phase.\\n3. Marshaling phase\\n3.1 Marshaling phase begins\\nThis step formalizes the beginning of the marshaling phase.\\n3.2 Active player collects income\\nThe first player is first to be the active player in the marshaling phase.\\nThe active player collects income equal to the gold value on his or her revealed plot card (which incorporates\\n        all relevant gold modifiers), and gains that much gold from the treasury, adding it to his or her gold pool.\\nMarshaling phase player action window\\nThe first player always has the first opportunity to act during this action window.\\nIn addition to being permitted to initiate \"Action\" and \"Marshaling Action\" abilities (like all players), the\\n        active player is also permitted (when it is his or her turn to act) to, as a player action, marshal a\\n        character, location, attachment, or duplicate. Action opportunities in this window continue in player order\\n        until each player has consecutively passed.\\nTIMING NOTE: Any player may also initiate Interrupt or Reaction abilities if the appropriate triggering\\n            condition occurs.\\nTo marshal a card, a player returns an amount of gold equal to the card\\'s gold cost from his or her gold pool to\\n        the treasury.\\nWhen a player marshals a character card, the card is placed in the front row of that player\\'s play area.\\nWhen a player marshals a location card, the card is placed in the back row of that player\\'s play area.\\nWhen a player marshals an attachment card, the card is attached to another card or game element in play. Some\\n        attachments have play restrictions or permissions that describe the type of card or game element to which they\\n        must be attached. If an attachment does not have any such restriction or permission, the default state for an\\n        attachment is that it attaches to a character.\\nWhen a player marshals a duplicate, it is placed faceup, overlapped by (i.e. partially visible beneath) the copy\\n        of the card that was already in play. There is no cost to marshal a duplicate.\\nAction opportunities continue clockwise in player order among the players until all players consecutively pass,\\n        at which point the action window closes. As such, there is no upper limit on the number of opportunities an\\n        active player may have to marshal his or her cards.\\n3.3 Next player becomes active player\\nIf upon reaching this step all players have been the active player this phase, proceed to step 3.4.\\nOtherwise, the next player (in player order) becomes the active player. Return to step 3.2.\\n3.4 Marshaling phase ends\\nThis step formalizes the end of the marshaling phase.\\n4. Challenges phase\\n4.1 Challenges phase begins\\nThis step formalizes the beginning of the challenges phase.\\n4.2 Active player may initiate a challenge\\nThe first player is the first to be the active player in the challenges phase.\\nThe game permits the active player to initiate one [military], one [intrigue], and one [power] challenge (in any\\n        order) while he or she is the active player during the challenges phase.\\nIf the active player passes this opportunity to initiate a challenge, or cannot initiate a challenge, proceed to\\n        step 4.3.\\nTo initiate a challenge, the active player does the following. The game treats these criteria as being performed\\n        atomically (all at once), and they must all be completed together in order to initiate a challenge.\\n\\nAnnounces the type of challenge ([military], [intrigue], or [power]) being initiated.\\nAnnounces the opponent against whom the challenge is being initiated.\\nAnnounces which characters (under his or her control) are being declared as attackers, and kneels them\\n            simultaneously. In order to be eligible as an attacker, a character must have a challenge icon that\\n            corresponds with the type of challenge being initiated, and the character must be standing. At least one\\n            character must be declared as an attacker to initiate a challenge. Any character with the stealth keyword\\n            that has been declared as an attacker also chooses its stealth targets at this time if its controller\\n            desires to use the stealth keyword.\\n        \\n\\nTIMING NOTE: Once a challenge is initiated, reactions to any of the above announcements may be\\n            initiated.\\nTIMING NOTE: Once a challenge is initiated, it is considered to be resolving until the challenge ends in step\\n            4.2.6.\\n4.2.1 Defending player declares defenders\\nThe defending player has the option to declare eligible characters he or she controls as defenders, and kneels\\n        them simultaneously. In order to be eligible as a defender, a character must have a challenge icon that\\n        corresponds with the type of challenge that is currently underway, and the character must be standing. A\\n        character that was chosen as a stealth target in step 4.2 is not eligible to be declared as a defender.\\n4.2.2 Compare STR to determine challenge winner\\nCompare the combined STR of all attacking characters (plus any active modifiers) to the combined STR of all\\n        defending characters (plus any active modifiers) to determine the challenge winner.\\nThe player whose side has the higher total STR wins the challenge (or in the case of a tie, the challenge is won\\n        by the attacking player). If this player does not have a total STR of 1 or higher, and/or if there are no\\n        participating characters on this player\\'s side when this step (i.e., the STR comparison) occurs, neither player\\n        wins (or loses) the challenge.\\nIf the attacking player is the winner, and the total STR on the defending side of the challenge was 0, the\\n        challenge is considered \"unopposed.\"\\nTIMING NOTE: Reactions to winning and/or losing the challenge may be initiated after the completion of this\\n            step.\\n4.2.3 Gain challenge bonuses\\nIf the challenge was unopposed in the previous step, the attacking player gains 1 power for his or her faction\\n        card for winning an unopposed challenge. This is known as an unopposed bonus.\\nIn a melee game, if the challenge was won against an opponent bearing a title which is denoted as a Rival on the\\n        winning player\\'s title (and the challenge winner has not already claimed power for defeating that Rival this\\n        round), the challenge winner gains 1 power for his or her faction. This is known as a rivals bonus.\\nAll challenge bonuses a player receives for this step are gained simultaneously.\\n4.2.4 Apply claim result.\\nIf the attacking player is the challenge winner, the claim result of the challenge is now applied. The claim\\n        result for each challenge type resolves as follows, using the claim value on the attacking player\\'s revealed\\n        plot card (and incorporating all relevant claim modifiers):\\n\\nMilitary: The defending player must choose a number of different characters under his or\\n            her control equal to the claim value, and kill those characters. (The chosen characters do not have to be\\n            characters that participated in the challenge.)\\n        \\nIntrigue: The defending player must discard, at random, a number of cards from his or her\\n            hand equal to the claim value.\\n        \\nPower: The defending player removes a number of power counters from his or her faction card\\n            equal to the claim value, and moves them to the attacking player\\'s faction card.\\n        \\n\\nIf the defending player wins the challenge, no claim result occurs.\\n4.2.5 Process challenge resolution keywords\\nChallenge resolution keywords (e.g. insight, intimidate, pillage, and renown) take effect at this time. The first\\n        player determines the order, by keyword type, in which these keywords are processed. The first player chooses\\n        one keyword type (for instance, renown), and then all relevant instances of that keyword resolve simultaneously.\\n        The first player then chooses the next keyword type to resolve, and so on, until all keyword types that need to\\n        resolve upon the resolution of the challenge have been processed.\\n4.2.6 Challenge ends\\nThis step formalizes the end of the challenge. All characters that were participating in the challenge are no\\n        longer participating. Proceed to the action window between framework steps 4.1 and 4.2.\\n4.3 Next player becomes active player\\nIf the active player does not declare a challenge, or cannot initiate any more challenges, the next player in\\n        player order becomes the active player. Proceed to the player action window between framework steps 4.1 and\\n        4.2.\\nIf all players have been the active player this phase, proceed to 4.4.\\n4.4 Challenges phase ends\\nThis step formalizes the end of the challenges phase.\\n5. Dominance phase\\n5.1 Dominance phase begins\\nThis step formalizes the beginning of the dominance phase.\\n5.2 Determine dominance\\nEach player simultaneously counts the total combined STR of all of his or her standing characters, and adds 1 to\\n        this total for each gold token in his or her gold pool. The player with the highest total wins dominance for the\\n        round, and gains 1 power for his or her faction. (Note: a player may win dominance with no standing\\n            characters.)\\nIf there is a tie for the highest total, no player wins dominance.\\n5.3 Dominance phase ends\\nThis step formalizes the end of the dominance phase.\\n6. Standing phase\\n6.1 Standing phase begins\\nThis step formalizes the beginning of the standing phase.\\n6.2 Stand cards\\nSimultaneously stand each kneeling card in play.\\n6.3 Standing phase ends\\nThis step formalizes the end of the standing phase.\\n7. Taxation phase\\n7.1 Taxation phase begins\\nThis step formalizes the beginning of the taxation phase.\\n7.2 Return unspent gold\\nEach player simultaneously returns all unspent gold in his or her gold pool to the treasury.\\n7.3 Check reserve\\nEach player, in player order, checks his or her reserve.\\nAny player with more cards in hand than the reserve value on his or her revealed plot card (which incorporates\\n        all relevant reserve modifiers) chooses and discards cards from his or her hand until that player\\'s hand size\\n        and reserve value are equal.\\nA player is not permitted to discard cards from his or her hand at this time while at or below his or her reserve\\n        value.\\n7.4 Return melee title cards (melee format only)\\nEach player returns his or her title to the title pool. All titles leave play simultaneously. (In a joust game,\\n        this step is skipped.)\\n7.5 Taxation phase ends\\nThis step formalizes the end of the taxation phase.\\nAs the taxation phase is the final phase in the round, this step also formalizes the end of the round. Any active\\n        \"until the end of the round\" lasting effects expire at this time.\\nAfter this step is complete, play proceeds to the beginning of the plot phase of the next game round.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout\\nAPI\\n\\nDonators\\n\\n\\nClear data\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            Designed and built by Alsciende.\\n        \\n\\n            Maintained by stopfstedt\\n            Contact:\\n            \\n\\n\\n            Cards data maintained with great dedication by the TheIronThrone.net team.\\n        \\n\\n            Please post bug reports and feature requests on GitHub.\\n        \\n\\n            You may contribute by giving money on Paypal.\\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n            The information presented on this site about A Game of Thrones: The Card Game Second Edition, both literal\\n            and graphical, is copyrighted by Fantasy Flight Games.\\n            This website is not produced, endorsed, supported, or affiliated with Fantasy Flight Games.\\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n×\\nModal title\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGo to card page\\nClose\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

The\\n                    terms are presented in alphabetical order.\\nChoose\\nThe word \"choose\" indicates that an ability selects one or more targets. In the absence of\\n                    the word \"choose,\" an ability is not considered to be a targeting ability.\\nDerived Information\\nDerived information is any information about the game, game state, or cards all players have had the\\n                    opportunity to learn through card/game effects or through the process of deduction using open\\n                    information. This includes any modified stats or text of a card, tokens assigned to particular\\n                    cards, choices a player made or actions a player took that are still affecting the game state\\n                    or a card(s), etc.\\nDerived information may be marked with the use of a token or other indicator so that players remember\\n                    the information. A player cannot misrepresent derived information or hide the open information\\n                    necessary to discover derived information.\\nIf derived information is dependent on a player\\'s previous decision or action, he or she must answer\\n                    truthfully when asked about that decision or action. For example, Steph chooses Military when\\n                    she reveals Calm Over\\n                        Westeros (Core Set, 8). During the Challenge Phase, Bryan forgets and asks Steph which\\n                    challenge type she chose for Calm Over Westeros. Steph must answer honestly that she chose Military.\\n                \\nIf derived information becomes hidden information, the player who made a previous decision or action\\n                    related to that information is not required to divulge any details about that decision or action.\\n                    For example, Bryan reveals\\n                    Summons and chooses\\n                    Ser Jaime Lannister, revealing the card to Steph. Later in the game round, Steph forgets what card\\n                    Bryan revealed from Summons, but Bryan is not required to tell her, as Ser Jaime Lannister\\n                    became hidden information (moving into Bryan\\'s hand) after the Summons effect finished resolving.\\n                \\nHidden Information\\nHidden information is any information about the game, game state, or cards unavailable to one or more\\n                    players.\\n                    This includes the cards in a player\\'s hand, unrevealed plot cards, etc. If a card is temporarily\\n                    revealed, it is\\n                    derived information for as long as the player(s) is able to uniquely identify that card.\\nA player cannot learn hidden information without the aid of a game effect, rule, or another player\\n                    verbally\\n                    communicating the information. However, if a player that has access to hidden information about the\\n                    game or a\\n                    card and chooses to verbally share it with his or her opponent, that player is not required to tell\\n                    the\\n                    truth.\\nOpen Information\\nOpen information is any information about the game, game state, or cards that is available to all\\n                    players. This\\n                    includes faceup cards in a player\\'s discard, dead, and used piles, the number of cards in a player\\'s\\n                    deck or\\n                    hand, any cards that have been removed from the game, the amount of gold and power a player has, and\\n                    any other\\n                    information continuously available to all players.\\nAll players are entitled access to open information and cannot hide open information from an opponent\\n                    or omit\\n                    specific details. A player must allow his or her opponent to discover the information themselves if\\n                    they attempt\\n                    to do so.\\nTerminal Condition\\nThis term describes a delayed effect, usually created by a constant ability or lasting effect, that\\n                    will attempt\\n                    to drive a card out of play whenever a certain condition is met. An example of a terminal condition\\n                    is:\\n                    \"Until the end of the phase, that character is killed if its STR is 0.\"\\nRulings and Clarifications\\nThis section contains additions and clarifications to the core game rules. Each entry is presented\\n                    with a unique section number so it can be easily identified when making rulings,\\n                    answering questions, or otherwise referring to the entry.\\nIt should be used in conjunction with the Rules Reference to establish the rules of play. If the text\\n                    of this document directly contradicts the text of the Rules Reference, the text of this document\\n                    takes precedence.\\n1. Game Play\\n(1.1) Infinite Loops\\nIt is possible, with certain card combinations, to create an \"infinite loop\" (such as having two\\n                    cards kneel to\\n                    stand each other indefinitely). When executing an infinite loop, a player follows these steps:\\n\\nClearly display the infinite loop to the opponent (and tournament judge, if the opponent\\n                        requires it). Thus,\\n                        the player must display, using all cards involved, one full cycle of the infinite loop.\\n                    \\nState how many times he or she wishes to execute the loop. For example, the player could say, \"I\\n                        will now\\n                        execute this loop seventeen times.\" Then, resolve the loop that many times instantly. If the\\n                        execution of\\n                        this loop causes the player to win the game, the game is over and the executing player wins.\\n                    \\n\\nInfinite loops should never be used to cause a game to stall.\\nWhen resolving the abilities within a loop, a player is not compelled to make a choice that would\\n                    avoid the continuation of the loop. For instance, if the only means to break a loop would be for a\\n                    player to make a choice he or she does not desire to make, the player is not compelled to make that\\n                    choice: as the player could theoretically keep the loop going forever, he or she is permitted\\n                    to voluntarily end the sequence after the chosen number of executions of the loop have been\\n                    completed without ever making the undesirable choice.\\n(1.2) Duplicates\\nIn order to bring a card into play as a duplicate, both the duplicate and the unique card that would\\n                    be duplicated must be owned and controlled by the player attempting the duplication.\\nA player cannot bring a unique card into play as a duplicate if another copy of that unique card is\\n                    in his or her dead pile.\\nMarshaling a duplicate is not considered to be marshaling a card with any of that card\\'s\\n                    characteristics. It is only considered to be \"marshaling a duplicate.\" While marshaling a duplicate,\\n                    that card is not subject to restrictions based on the card\\'s printed characteristics,\\n                    including cardtype, faction, keywords, etc.\\n(1.3) Unique cards in play and in the dead pile\\nThe following defines the control and ownership rules surrounding unique cards:\\n\\nA player cannot marshal, put into play, or take/gain control of a unique card if another copy of\\n                        that card is in his or her dead pile.\\nA player cannot marshal or put into play a copy of an opponent\\'s unique card if another copy of\\n                        that unique card (owned either by the player attempting to bring the card into play,\\n                        or by the opponent who owns the unique card that is attempting to enter play) is already in play\\n                        or is in its owner\\'s dead pile.\\nAn ability that puts a unique card into play from a player\\'s dead pile functions only if there\\n                        would be no other copies of that card in that dead pile upon resolution of the ability.\\nIf a player controls a unique card that he or she does not own, that player and that card\\'s\\n                        owner cannot marshal or put into play additional copies of that card, regardless of ownership.\\n                    \\nIf a player controls a unique card (regardless of ownership) that player cannot take/gain\\n                        control of other copies of that card.\\nIf a player owns and controls a unique card, each other copy of that card that he or she owns\\n                        and controls that would enter play does so as a duplicate.\\n\\n(1.4) Control of Tokens\\nTokens are not considered to be under a player\\'s control. Rather, tokens exist either in game areas\\n                    (such as in a player\\'s gold pool) a player controls or on cards (such as on a faction card or on a\\n                    character) that are under a player\\'s control.\\n\\nA player\\'s power total is determined by counting the total number of power on cards he or she\\n                        controls.\\nUnless otherwise specified by an ability, a player may only use tokens that are in game areas or\\n                        on cards he or she controls to pay costs.\\n\\n(1.5) Playing Events\\nPlaying an event is defined as the process by which an event is revealed from its owner\\'s hand, its\\n                    costs are paid and targets chosen (if applicable), its effects resolve (or are canceled),\\n                    and it is placed in its owner\\'s discard pile.\\nAfter an event\\'s costs are paid and its targets chosen (if applicable), that event leaves its\\n                    controller\\'s hand. During steps 6 and 7 of ability initiation (\\n                    \\n                        Rules Reference, page 10), the event is in the process of being played, and is not\\n                    considered to be in any specific out-of-play area. The event is placed in its owner\\'s discard pile\\n                    after its effects are resolved in step 7.\\nSome events have additional abilities that can only be triggered while the event is not in its\\n                    owner\\'s hand. Triggering such an ability is not considered to be \"playing an event,\" and does\\n                    not require paying the event\\'s normal cost, only the cost of that ability.\\nFor example: The Prince\\'s Plan\\n                        (Blood and Gold, 16) has the ability \"Reaction: After you lose a challenge,\\n                        pay 1 gold to return The Prince\\'s Plan from your discard pile to your hand.\"\\n                        Triggering this ability is not considered playing the event, so you need only pay the 1 gold\\n                        described in the ability\\'s text, and not the 2 gold cost of playing The Prince\\'s Plan.\\nIf an ability cancels the \"effects of an event,\" that ability can cancel the effects of\\n                    any triggered ability on an event card.\\n(1.6) Priority of Simultaneous Resolution\\nIf two or more constant abilities and/or lasting effects cannot be applied simultaneously, the first\\n                    player determines the order in which those constant abilities or lasting effects are applied.\\n                    If the two abilities cannot coexist, the first player determines which one applies.\\nThis determination is made only once, at the time the conflicting abilities would first affect the\\n                    game state. This choice is then maintained as long as the conflicting abilities remain active.\\n                    If at any point an additional conflicting ability becomes active, the first player may make a\\n                    new determination.\\nFor example: The first player has\\n                        Varys\\'s Riddle\\n                        (War of Five Kings, 20) revealed, while that player\\'s opponent has\\n                        Summer Harvest\\n                        (War of Five Kings, 39) revealed, creating two conflicting values for the gold value on\\n                        Summer Harvest. When the Summer Harvest player collects income,\\n                        the first player will choose which value applies. If another effect  later in the\\n                        round references the gold value on Summer Harvest (for instance,\\n                        Underground Vault\\n                        (Blood and Gold, 46)), the same gold value will be used.\\n(1.7) Paying Costs\\nThe resolution of some effects (such as post-then effects or delayed effects) requires that costs are\\n                    paid after the initiation of the effect. Such costs need not be verified when initiating the ability\\n                    and determining if its costs can be paid. If such costs cannot be paid at the required time, that\\n                    aspect of the effect fails to resolve.\\n\\n                    (1.8) Interrupts and Reactions to Abilities with \"Then\" Effects\\n                \\nIf the effect text of an ability includes the word \"then,\" the pre-then and post-then aspects of the\\n                    effect share a common reaction window, which opens after the entire effect has resolved. Reactions\\n                    to costs paid as part of the post-then aspect of the ability also share this reaction window.\\n                    Interrupts may be initiated during the resolution of such effects any time their triggering\\n                    condition occurs, meaning that the pre-then and post-then aspects of the ability may be\\n                    interrupted separately.\\n(1.9) Card Abilities During Setup\\nBecause setup occurs before the game begins, card abilities are not active during setup unless the\\n                    ability specifically references setup or a timing point during setup (such as \"after all agendas are\\n                    announced\").\\n                \\nFor example: Oldtown Scholar\\n                        (Sands of Dorne, 41) cannot trigger its reaction after a player replenishes his or her hand\\n                        during step 10 of setup.\\n2. Card Ability Interpretation\\n(2.1) Cannot be {Variable}ed\\nIf a card \"cannot be {variable}ed,\" where {variable} is something that would happen\\n                    to the card such as \"killed,\" \"discarded,\" or \"knelt,\" that card\\n                    cannot be chosen to be {variable}ed by a card ability or game effect that would {variable} the card.\\n                    Further, a card that cannot be {variable}ed ignores any non-targeting ability or game\\n                    effect that would {variable} it.\\nFor example: A card that \"cannot be killed\" cannot be chosen to be killed to satisfy\\n                        military challenge claim, cannot be chosen as the target of an ability that would kill it,\\n                        and it would ignore the effect of an ability that reads,\\n                        \"Kill each character in play.\"\\n(2.2) Delayed Effects and Immunity\\nFor the purpose of determining whether or not a card is immune to a delayed effect, the delayed\\n                    effect is considered to be an effect of the card and card type that created it.\\n(2.3) Referential Targets\\nSome abilities require the choice of a target that is not directly affected by the ability-the target\\n                    is instead chosen as a reference point while resolving the ability. When choosing referential\\n                    targets, a player is not bound by the rule that a target is ineligible if the resolution of the\\n                    effect would not affect the chosen target.\\nFor example: Wildfire Assault\\n                        (Core, 26) allows each player to choose up to 3 characters he or she controls.\\n                        The effect then resolves on the characters not chosen. The targets chosen by this ability are\\n                        \"referential targets,\" and a player is not bound by the rule that the chosen targets\\n                        are affected by Wildfire Assault\\'s effect, as this would be impossible:\\n                        the chosen targets for this ability are never affected by its effect.\\n(2.4) Card Abilities & Out-of-Play Areas\\nSome card abilities attempt to interact with a card while it is in a specific out-of-play area. Such\\n                    an aspect of a card ability cannot interact with a card that is not in that specific out-of-play\\n                    area. Note that some abilities implicitly refer to the out-of-play area with which they can\\n                    interact. For instance, a reaction that interacts with a character after it\\'s killed implicitly\\n                    interacts with that character while it is in the dead pile, and a reaction that interacts with a\\n                    card after it\\'s discarded implicitly interacts with that card while it is in the discard pile.\\nFor example: Hot Pie\\n                        (Westeros, 57) is discarded from a player\\'s deck. An opponent plays\\n                        Now My Watch Begins\\n                        (Watchers on the Wall, 23) to put Hot Pie into play. Although the reaction window to Hot Pie\\n                        being discarded is still open,\\n                        Crone of Vaes Dothrak\\'s\\n                        (Westeros, 53) reaction can no longer be used on Hot Pie, as he is no longer in the discard\\n                        pile.\\n(2.5) References to Specific Positions in Game\\n                    Areas\\nAn ability that refers to a card in a specific position within a game area (such as a player\\'s\\n                    \"revealed plot card\" or the \"top card of a player\\'s deck\")\\n                    refers to any card that occupies that position while the ability is active, not just the card that\\n                    occupies that position at the time the ability initiates. For instance, if a lasting effect raises\\n                    the claim value on a player\\'s revealed plot card by 1 until the end of the phase, and that player\\n                    subsequently reveals a new plot card during the phase, that lasting effect will remain active on the\\n                    new plot card.\\n(2.6) Timing of Terminal Condition Effects\\nSome abilities create a delayed effect that will attempt to drive a character from play whenever a\\n                    certain condition is met. The most common of these is the \"terminal burn\" effect,\\n                    which kills a character if its STR is 0. Such an effect resolves automatically and immediately after\\n                    the condition occurs, before any reactions to that moment may be used. If a character with a\\n                    terminal burn effect applied has its STR reduced to 0, the following timing sequence is observed:\\n                \\n\\nThe STR-reduction effect becomes imminent.\\nInterrupts to the STR-reduction effect may be used.\\nThe STR-reduction effect resolves, reducing the character\\'s STR to 0.\\nThe \"terminal burn\" kill effect becomes imminent.\\nInterrupts to the kill effect may be used.\\nThe kill effect resolves.\\nReactions to the kill effect, or to the character\\'s STR being reduced, may be used.\\n\\nNote that at any point after Step 3, the character\\'s STR is 0.\\n(2.7) The Word \"You\"\\nIf a card ability uses the word \"you\" or \"your,\" that pronoun generally refers to\\n                    the controller of the card.\\nSome cards have abilities that may be triggered by a player other than the card\\'s controller. In the\\n                    text of such abilities, the word \"you\" or \"your\" refers to the player who is\\n                    triggering the ability.\\n(2.8) Spending Gold\\nIf a card ability allows a player to \"spend\" gold as if it were in his or her gold pool,\\n                    that gold may be used any time that player could voluntarily pay or move gold from his or her gold\\n                    pool. This includes paying costs of cards or abilities, giving gold to an opponent, and moving gold\\n                    using the bestow keyword.\\n(2.9) The Word \"All\"\\nIf an effect causes a card to lose \"all\" of a given attribute (such as keywords, traits, or\\n                    faction affiliations), that card loses each instance of each of those attributes. For instance, if\\n                    an effect causes a character to \"lose all Traits,\" that character will have no\\n                    traits (even if another effect would cause it to have multiple instances of a given trait).\\nFor example: A Hedge Knight\\n                        (Westeros, 57) has the Knighted\\n                        (Westeros, 58) attachment.\\n                        If I Am No One\\n                        (Flight of Crows, 82) is played on the Hedge Knight, it will no longer have the Knight\\n                        trait.\\n(2.10) Characters contributing their STR\\nA character may contribute its STR to a challenge in one of two ways: by participating in\\n                    that challenge as an attacker or defender; or, by the effects of a card ability. Some card abilities\\n                    may cause a character to contribute its STR to a player\\'s side during a challenge without affecting\\n                    the participating status of that character.\\n                \\n\\nWhen STR is compared to determine the winner of a challenge (Step 4.2.2), the STR of any\\n                        character that is contributing its STR to a player\\'s side during that challenge is added to that\\n                        player\\'s total. Only add each character\\'s STR once, even if a character contributes its STR from\\n                        multiple sources.\\nA character can only contribute its STR to one player\\'s side during a challenge. If a character\\n                        would contribute its STR to more than one player\\'s side, the most recent effect prevails. This\\n                        includes a character contributing its STR to a challenge by becoming a participating character.\\n                    \\nIf an ability explicitly removes a character from a challenge, that ability only affects the\\n                        participating status of that character. It will not remove the STR contribution of a character\\n                        that is contributing its STR to a challenge by the effects of a card ability.\\nAny card ability that explicitly says a character does not contribute its STR to a challenge\\n                        takes precedence over any card ability or framework effect that says the opposite.\\n\\nFor example: During a military challenge, Dennis uses the ability of\\n                        Anya Waynwood\\n                        (As High as Honor, 18) to have Richard\\'s\\n                        Grand Maester Pycelle\\n                        (Core, 85) contribute his STR to Dennis\\'s side. In response, Richard plays\\n                        My Mind Is My Weapon\\n                        (Kings of the Isles, 28) to have Pycelle participate in the challenge and contribute his STR to\\n                        Richard\\'s side instead. Finally, Dennis ambushes\\n                        Areo Hotah (Core, 103) and\\n                        removes Pycelle from the challenge. Since Anya\\'s effect is now the most recent one, Pycelle\\n                        contributes his STR to Dennis\\'s side when the winner of the challenge is determined.\\n                        (Note that Pycelle is not actually participating in the challenge at this point, so neither\\n                        player can draw a card for insight.)\\n3. Dynamic Situations\\n(3.1) Saving from a Terminal Condition\\nWhen determining if a save effect has the potential to remedy an ongoing terminal condition,\\n                    anticipate only the application of all aspects of the effect that is producing the save as well as\\n                    all lasting effects and constant abilities that would be affecting the card upon application of the\\n                    effect.\\nIf multiple effects would simultaneously attempt to drive a character out of play due to a terminal\\n                    condition, the first player chooses the order in which those effects resolve. If a save used on the\\n                    first removal effect also remedies the ongoing terminal condition, the subsequent removal effect(s)\\n                    tied to that terminal condition will not resolve.\\nFor example: Dracarys! (Core, 176)\\n                        is played on Dagmer Cleftjaw\\n                        (Westeros, 111) while the plot\\n                        Blood of the Dragon\\n                        (Westeros, 75) is revealed. Dagmer\\'s STR is reduced to 0, and he is subject to the\\n                        \"killed if its STR is 0\" effects of both cards. The first player decides to have Blood\\n                        of the Dragon\\'s kill effect resolve first. Dagmer\\'s controller interrupts that effect with\\n                        Risen from the Sea (Core, 81),\\n                        saving Dagmer and giving him +1 STR. Because Dagmer\\'s STR is now 1, the kill effect from\\n                        Dracarys! does not resolve, and Dagmer remains in play.\\n(3.2) Saving from a Cost\\nIf a card would leave play as part of the cost of initiating an ability, that card cannot be saved.\\n                \\n(3.3) Player Choices While Initiating Abilities\\nPlayer choices made as part of the initiating an ability/marshaling a card process (\\n                    Rules\\n                        Reference, page 10), including the choosing of targets, are constrained to those that were\\n                    established as legal options in Step 1 of that process, where the legality of initiating the ability\\n                    was checked.\\nIf a change in the game state between Step 1 and Step 7 creates a situation in which there are no\\n                    legal targets at the time targets are chosen, or a situation in which a choice must be made but\\n                    there are no valid options for that choice, the ability is considered to resolve unsuccessfully.\\n                    An event that resolves unsuccessfully is placed in its owner\\'s discard pile.\\n(3.4) Challenge Icons\\nA character is considered to have a challenge icon or to not have that icon. A single character that\\n                    has and/or\\n                    is gaining the same challenge icon from multiple sources functions as if it has one instance of that\\n                    icon.\\n(3.5) Multiple Copies of the Same Agenda\\nA player cannot run more than 1 copy of each different agenda (by title), even in situations where\\n                    they are allowed to run multiple agendas.\\nCard Legality\\nFor most events, a product is legal from the time of its release until the time of its rotation\\n                    (if applicable). Tournament Organizers have authority to determine the legality of newly-released\\n                    cards if they feel there has not been enough time before their event for all players to familiarize\\n                    themselves with the new set. For a current list of legal product, see the GOT website, here:\\n\\n                        https://agot.cards/category/global-operations-team/restricted-list-faq\\n                    \\n\\nFrequently Asked Questions\\nThis section provides answers to a number of common questions that are asked about the game. The\\n                    entries are presented in a \"question and answer\" format, with the newest questions at the\\n                    end of the list.\\nCatelyn Stark\\nWhich abilities does Catelyn Stark\\n                        (Core, 143) prevent an opponent from using?\\nCatelyn prevents an opponent from using triggered card abilities that he or she would\\n                        initiate. A triggered ability is indicated by a bold timing trigger, such as\\n                    Action, Interrupt, Reaction, Dominance Action, and so forth. Catelyn prevents an\\n                    opponent from initiating such bold-faced abilities. However, Forced abilities and\\n                    When Revealed abilities are initiated automatically by the game (as opposed\\n                    to being initiated by the player who controls the card), so Catelyn does not prevent these two\\n                    classes of triggered abilities. Additionally, using a duplicate is defined as a triggered\\n                    game ability(as opposed to a triggered card ability), and therefore Catelyn does\\n                    not prevent the use of duplicates. Finally, any ability that is not prefaced with a bold timing\\n                    trigger (such as a keyword, like ambush) is not considered a triggered ability, and is not\\n                    prevented by Catelyn\\'s text.\\nMelisandre + Seen in Flames\\nWhen can I trigger Melisandre\\'s\\n                        (Core, 47) reaction to \"playing\" a R\\'hllor event such as\\n                        Seen in Flames (Core, 64) -\\n                        before or after the effect of Seen in Flames occurs?\\nThe act of playing an event entails paying its costs, resolving its effects (or having those effects\\n                    canceled), and placing the event in its owner\\'s discard pile. Reactions to playing an event may only\\n                    be triggered after this process is complete. Therefore, the effect of Seen in Flames is resolved\\n                    before Melisandre\\'s reaction to playing the event may be triggered.\\nThe Hand\\'s Judgment\\nWhile I am in the process of playing a\\n                        Hand\\'s Judgment (Core, 45)\\n                        from my hand, and my opponent uses another event card to attempt to cancel my Hand\\'s Judgment,\\n                        can I attempt to play that same copy of my Hand\\'s Judgement a second time to cancel my\\n                        opponent\\'s event?\\nNo. At the time the opponent\\'s cancel would initiate, Hand\\'s Judgment is in the process of being\\n                    played and is no longer in your hand. Therefore, you are unable to play that copy of Hand\\'s\\n                    Judgment. (You could, however, play another copy of the card.)\\nNymeria Sand\\nCan Nymeria Sand (Westeros, 35) be\\n                        used to cause a character to lose a challenge icon it does not currently possess, so that each\\n                        of my Sand Snake characters can gain that icon?\\nYes. There are no targeting restrictions on Nymeria Sand\\'s ability beyond \"choose an opponent\\'s\\n                    character,\" so any opponent\\'s character is an eligible choice. If you choose an icon type that\\n                    the chosen character does not possess, a lasting effect causing that character to lose one instance\\n                    of that icon is still applied to that character for the duration of the effect. (This means that the\\n                    character would now have to gain an additional instance of the icon type to function as if it had\\n                    the icon.) Finally, the subsequent gaining of that icon type by each of your\\n                    Sand Snake characters is not dependent upon the opponent\\'s character\\n                    losing a functional version of the icon.\\n                \\nAttachments in Setup\\nIf I place an attachment in setup that would have a legal target among the other cards I have\\n                        placed, can I, after revealing setup cards, decide to attach it to a legal target in an\\n                        opponent\\'s setup?\\nNo. Setup cards may only be attached to revealed cards you control.\\nAttachments in Setup #2\\nWhen I am attaching my cards during setup, do I attach them all at once or one at a time?\\n                    \\nAll of a player\\'s attachments are attached simultaneously during setup. While placing cards for\\n                    setup, you cannot use one attachment to create a condition in which another attachment is legally\\n                    attached. In other words, you cannot setup the\\n                    Knighted (Westeros, 58) attachment on\\n                    a non-Knight character so that you can also setup the\\n                    Mare in Heat (Westeros, 44)\\n                    attachment on the same character.\\nIf upon completion of attaching cards during setup one attachment has created a game state in which\\n                    another attachment is illegally attached, immediately discard the illegal attachment.\\nAttacking Alone\\nIf I win a challenge in which I control two attacking Knight characters and one\\n                        of them is targeted by\\n                        Ghaston Grey (Core, 116),\\n                        returning it to my hand and leaving me with one attacking Knight character, may\\n                        I subsequently play\\n                        Lady Sansa\\'s Rose (Westeros, 24)\\n                        by virtue of that single Knight who is now attacking alone?\\nYes, you may. Lady Sansa\\'s Rose reads \"...in which you control a Knight character that\\n                    is attacking alone,\" and the check on \"is attacking alone\" is made at the time the\\n                    event would be played.\\nLimited Card as Duplicate\\nIf I play a limited card as a duplicate, does it count as my limited card for the round?\\nNo. When you marshal a card as a duplicate, it is not considered to have any of its printed keywords,\\n                    including the limited keyword.\\nWolves of the North\\nI am declaring two copies of the card\\n                        Wolves of the North\\n                        (Wolves of the North, 6) as attackers. Can each copy choose the same target for stealth when I\\n                        declare stealth targets?\\nThe timing of declaring stealth targets is considered to be simultaneous with the declaration of the\\n                    challenge, opponent, and attackers. Each stealth target, however, is declared independently, and\\n                    each Wolves of the North may select the same target for its stealth ability.\\nMaster of Whispers + Trial by Combat\\nHow does the Master of Whispers\\n                        (Core, 206) title ability work with claim replacement or adjustment effects such as\\n                        Trial by Combat (Westeros, 90),\\n                        Vengeance for Elia (Westeros, 96)\\n                        , and Mirri Maz Duur\\n                        (Westeros, 93)?\\nThe Master of Whispers ability is not itself a claim replacement ability, and therefore functions\\n                    alongside claim replacement effects as much as it is able, based on the language of the particular\\n                    effect in question.\\nFor Trial by Combat, each opponent you choose will suffer the military claim.\\nFor Vengeance for Elia, the player who lost the challenge (if The Masters of Whispers player decides\\n                    the loser of the challenge will be resolving claim) can cause a different opponent to suffer that\\n                    claim for him or her, and the attacker may also still resolve the claim against some or all of the\\n                    other opponents as well. Note that if a player who is already responsible for satisfying claim\\n                    (due to Master of Whispers) is chosen as the target of Vengeance for Elia, that player still only\\n                    applies the claim result once, and this satisfies both obligations.\\nFor Mirri Maz Duur, her ability requires that you choose one character controlled by the losing\\n                    opponent, and kills that character. As only one character is chosen to be killed by this ability,\\n                    the resolution of Mirri\\'s claim against other opponents does nothing, and there is no interaction\\n                    between these two cards.\\nDragon Sight\\nIf I play Dragon Sight\\n                        (Wolves of the North, 36) in the challenge action window before declaring defenders, will any\\n                        defenders that are subsequently declared be affected by the Dragon Sight effect?\\nNo. If an ability creates a lasting effect on a set of cards, it only affects the cards that are\\n                    eligible at the time the event card is played.\\nConversely, if a character that had been participating in a challenge and affected by Dragon Sight is\\n                    somehow removed from the challenge, the lasting effect remains in effect on that character until the\\n                    end of the challenge, regardless of its status as participating or not.\\nMultiple \"Take Control\" Effects\\nHow do multiple \"take control\" effects work? For instance, if one opponent gains\\n                        control of my character with\\n                        Take the Black (Core, 139), and\\n                        then another opponent takes control of that same character with\\n                        Ward (Westeros, 102), what\\n                        happens to the character if Ward is discarded?\\nUpon the expiration or cessation of a control change effect, control of the card reverts back to the\\n                    player with the nextmost recent take control effect that would affect on the card. (If no player\\n                    possesses a control effect that would affect the card, control reverts back to the card\\'s owner.)\\n                    In this example, when the Ward card leaves play, control of the character reverts back to the player\\n                    who had gained control of it with Take the Black.\\nResolving Keywords\\nIf I win a challenge in which I control both\\n                        Ser Gregor Clegane (Westeros, 49)\\n                        and Euron Crow\\'s Eye (Core, 69),\\n                        which player chooses the order in which their pillage abilities resolve?\\nAs the controller of the two characters, you choose the order in which their pillage abilities\\n                    resolve. Although the first player determines the order in which keywords are processed, by type,\\n                    the first player does not determine the order in which keywords resolve within each type. Because\\n                    each instance of pillage is optional, the controller of the characters with pillage chooses in which\\n                    order the pillage abilities resolve.\\nProcessing Keywords\\nWhat happens if a character gains a challenge resolution keyword while another challenge\\n                        resolution keyword is being processed?\\nEach keyword type can only be processed once during challenge resolution. If a character gains a\\n                    keyword after that keyword has already been processed, that character\\'s instance of the keyword will\\n                    not resolve. However, if a character gains a keyword that has not yet been processed, or is\\n                    currently being processed, that instance of the keyword will be able to resolve. Note that a keyword\\n                    can only be processed if a relevant instance of that keyword is present in the challenge.\\nVarys\\'s Riddle + Summer Harvest\\nIf I reveal Varys\\'s Riddle\\n                        (War of Five Kings, 20) and my opponent reveals\\n                        Summer Harvest\\n                        (War of Five Kings, 39), what will the base gold value on Summer Harvest be?\\nVarys\\'s Riddle allows you to initiate the ability on Summer Harvest as if you had just revealed it.\\n                    This means that Summer Harvest\\'s ability will trigger twice: one will be the \"original\"\\n                    version triggered by your opponent, while the other will be a version \"as if you had just\\n                    revealed it,\" which changes who is an eligible target for \"Choose an opponent.\"\\n                    These abilities will each attempt to define the gold value on Summer Harvest: the\\n                    \"original\" will look at the printed gold value on Varys\\'s Riddle (which is 5) and define\\n                    its base gold value as 7, while the other will look at the printed gold value on Summer Harvest\\n                    (which is X, treated as 0) and define its base gold value as 2. Because these two lasting effects\\n                    cannot be applied simultaneously, the first player chooses the order in which to apply them, and the\\n                    base gold value on Summer Harvest will either be 2 or 7 based on the first player\\'s choice.\\nAt Prince Doran\\'s Behest\\nIf I use At Prince Doran\\'s Behest\\n                        (Sands of Dorne, 46) to reveal another plot with a when revealed ability, and my opponent also\\n                        has a plot with a when revealed ability waiting to initiate, which plot\\'s ability initiates\\n                        first?\\nThe first player chooses the order in which the remaining when revealed abilities initiate. The newly\\n                    revealed plot does not have any special timing priority - it is simply treated as another plot card\\n                    with a when revealed ability that needs to be initiated as part of step 1.3.III (\"\\n                    \\n                        Initiate When Revealed abilities\\n                    \"). Note that initiative has already been compared in step I, so there will be no new\\n                    initiative comparison when the new plot is revealed in step III (i.e. the first player will not\\n                    change).\\nDaenerys Targaryen (TFM)\\nWhat card effects are covered by the constant ability on\\n                        Daenerys Targaryen\\n                        (Flight of Crows, 93)?\\nDaenerys Targaryen\\'s ability prevents her STR from being reduced by card effects. If a card effect\\n                    applies a STR modifier that would reduce her STR, that modifier is ignored. This includes\\n                    subtractive modifiers and halving modifiers, as well as any modifier that would \"set\" her\\n                    STR to a value that is lower than her base STR.\\nTycho Nestoris\\nHow does Tycho Nestoris\\n                        (Dance of Shadows, 37) work in situations where all of a player\\'s opponents are eliminated\\n                        (for instance, due to running out of cards in their deck)? How does he work in tournament games\\n                        that go to time?\\nIf a player controls Tycho Nestoris and his \"You cannot win the game\" ability is active,\\n                    nothing within the game rules can cause that player to win the game. If all of that player\\'s\\n                    opponents are eliminated, the game ends with no winner. (In a tournament, this is recorded as a loss\\n                    for each player.)\\nIf a tournament game goes to time with a player controlling Tycho at 15 or more power, that player\\'s\\n                    opponent receives a modified win, as that opponent is considered to be closer to their victory\\n                    condition. If a tournament game goes to time with both players controlling Tycho, both players\\n                    receive a loss.\\nIf a player controls Tycho at the end of a Melee game, the best placement that player can achieve is\\n                    2nd place. If a tournament Melee game goes to time and a player controlling Tycho has the highest\\n                    power total, the player with the next-highest power total is the winner of the game.\\nTycho does not prevent a player from winning if that player\\'s opponent concedes the game.\\nThe Hand\\'s Judgment + shadow events\\nCan The Hand\\'s Judgment (Core, 45)\\n                        be used to cancel an event with a \"-\" cost?\\nYes. The Hand\\'s Judgment has a cost of X, where X is defined as the printed cost of the event being\\n                    canceled.

The terms are\\r\\npresented in alphabetical order.\\r\\nChoose\\r\\nThe word \"choose\" indicates that an ability selects one or\\r\\nmore targets. In the absence of the word \"choose,\" an ability\\r\\nis not considered to be a targeting ability.\\r\\nDerived Information\\r\\nDerived information is any information about the game,\\r\\ngame state, or cards all players have had the opportunity to\\r\\nlearn through card/game effects or through the process of\\r\\ndeduction using open information. This includes any\\r\\nmodified stats or text of a card, tokens assigned to particular\\r\\ncards, choices a player made or actions a player took that are\\r\\nstill affecting the game state or a card(s), etc.\\r\\nDerived information may be marked with the use of a token\\r\\nor other indicator so that players remember the information.\\r\\nA player cannot misrepresent derived information or hide\\r\\nthe open information necessary to discover derived\\r\\ninformation.\\r\\nIf derived information is dependent on a player\\'s previous\\r\\ndecision or action, he or she must answer truthfully when\\r\\nasked about that decision or action. For example, Steph\\r\\nchooses Military when she reveals Calm Over Westeros\\r\\n(Core Set, 8). During the Challenge Phase, Bryan forgets and\\r\\nasks Steph which challenge type she chose for Calm Over\\r\\nWesteros. Steph must answer honestly that she chose\\r\\nMilitary.\\r\\nIf derived information becomes hidden information, the\\r\\nplayer who made a previous decision or action related to that\\r\\ninformation is not required to divulge any details about that\\r\\ndecision or action. For example, Bryan reveals Summons and\\r\\nchooses Ser Jaime Lannister, revealing the card to Steph.\\r\\nLater in the game round, Steph forgets what card Bryan\\r\\nrevealed from Summons, but Bryan is not required to tell\\r\\nher, as Ser Jaime Lannister became hidden information\\r\\n(moving into Bryan\\'s hand) after the Summons effect\\r\\nfinished resolving.\\r\\nHidden Information\\r\\nHidden information is any information about the game,\\r\\ngame state, or cards unavailable to one or more players. This\\r\\nincludes the cards in a player\\'s hand, unrevealed plot cards,\\r\\netc. If a card is temporarily revealed, it is derived\\r\\ninformation for as long as the player(s) is able to uniquely\\r\\nidentify that card.\\r\\nA player cannot learn hidden information without the aid of\\r\\na game effect, rule, or another player verbally\\r\\ncommunicating the information. However, if a player that\\r\\nhas access to hidden information about the game or a card\\r\\nand chooses to verbally share it with his or her opponent,\\r\\nthat player is not required to tell the truth.\\r\\nOpen Information\\r\\nOpen information is any information about the game, game\\r\\nstate, or cards that is available to all players. This includes\\r\\nfaceup cards in a player\\'s discard, dead, and used piles, the\\r\\nnumber of cards in a player\\'s deck or hand, any cards that\\r\\nhave been removed from the game, the amount of gold and\\r\\n1\\n'),\n",

A player must allow his or her opponent to\\r\\ndiscover the information themselves if they attempt to do so.\\r\\nTerminal Condition\\r\\nThis term describes a delayed effect, usually created by a\\r\\nconstant ability or lasting effect, that will attempt to drive a\\r\\ncard out of play whenever a certain condition is met. An\\r\\nexample of a terminal condition is: “Until the end of the phase,\\r\\nthat character is killed if its STR is 0.”\\r\\nRULINGS AND CLARIFICATIONS\\r\\nThis section contains additions and clarifications to the core\\r\\ngame rules. Each entry is presented with a unique section\\r\\nnumber so it can be easily identified when making rulings,\\r\\nanswering questions, or otherwise referring to the entry.\\r\\nIt should be used in conjunction with the Rules Reference to\\r\\nestablish the rules of play. If the text of this document\\r\\ndirectly contradicts the text of the Rules Reference, the text\\r\\nof this document takes precedence.\\r\\n1. GAME PLAY\\r\\n(1.1) Infinite Loops\\r\\nIt is possible, with certain card combinations, to create an\\r\\n“infinite loop” (such as having two cards kneel to stand each\\r\\nother indefinitely). When executing an infinite loop, a player\\r\\nfollows these steps:\\r\\n1. Clearly display the infinite loop to the opponent (and\\r\\ntournament judge, if the opponent requires it). Thus, the\\r\\nplayer must display, using all cards involved, one full cycle of\\r\\nthe infinite loop.\\r\\n2. State how many times he or she wishes to execute the\\r\\nloop. For example, the player could say, “I will now execute\\r\\nthis loop seventeen times.” Then, resolve the loop that many\\r\\ntimes instantly. If the execution of this loop causes the\\r\\nplayer to win the game, the game is over and the executing\\r\\nplayer wins.\\r\\nInfinite loops should never be used to cause a game to stall.\\r\\nWhen resolving the abilities within a loop, a player is not\\r\\ncompelled to make a choice that would avoid the\\r\\ncontinuation of the loop. For instance, if the only means to\\r\\nbreak a loop would be for a player to make a choice he or she\\r\\ndoes not desire to make, the player is not compelled to make\\r\\nthat choice: as the player could theoretically keep the loop\\r\\ngoing forever, he or she is permitted to voluntarily end the\\r\\nsequence after the chosen number of executions of the loop\\r\\nhave been completed without ever making the undesirable\\r\\nchoice.\\r\\n(1.2) Duplicates\\r\\nIn order to bring a card into play as a duplicate, both the\\r\\nduplicate and the unique card that would be duplicated must\\r\\nbe owned and controlled by the player attempting the\\r\\nduplication. A player cannot bring a unique card into play as\\r\\na duplicate if another copy of that unique card is in his or\\r\\nher dead pile.\\r\\nMarshaling a duplicate is not considered to be marshaling a\\r\\ncard with any of that card’s characteristics. It is only\\r\\nconsidered to be “marshaling a duplicate.” While marshaling\\r\\na duplicate, that card is not subject to restrictions based on\\r\\nthe card’s printed characteristics, including cardtype,\\r\\nfaction, keywords, etc.\\r\\n(1.3) Unique cards in play and in the dead pile\\r\\nThe following defines the control and ownership rules\\r\\nsurrounding unique cards:\\r\\n✦A player cannot marshal, put into play, or take/gain\\r\\ncontrol of a unique card if another copy of that card is\\r\\nin his or her dead pile.\\r\\n✦A player cannot marshal or put into play a copy of an\\r\\nopponent’s unique card if another copy of that unique\\r\\ncard (owned either by the player attempting to bring\\r\\nthe card into play, or by the opponent who owns the\\r\\nunique card that is attempting to enter play) is already\\r\\nin play or is in its owner’s dead pile.\\r\\n✦An ability that puts a unique card into play from a\\r\\nplayer’s dead pile functions only if there would be no\\r\\nother copies of that card in that dead pile upon\\r\\nresolution of the ability.\\r\\n✦If a player controls a unique card that he or she does\\r\\nnot own, that player and that card’s owner cannot\\r\\nmarshal or put into play additional copies of that card,\\r\\nregardless of ownership.\\r\\n✦If a player controls a unique card (regardless of\\r\\nownership) that player cannot take/gain control of\\r\\nother copies of that card.\\r\\n✦If a player owns and controls a unique card, each other\\r\\ncopy of that card that he or she owns and controls that\\r\\nwould enter play does so as a duplicate.\\r\\n(1.4) Control of Tokens\\r\\nTokens are not considered to be under a player’s control.\\r\\nRather, tokens exist either in game areas (such as in a\\r\\nplayer’s gold pool) a player controls or on cards (such as on a\\r\\nfaction card or on a character) that are under a player’s\\r\\ncontrol.\\r\\n✦A player’s power total is determined by counting the\\r\\ntotal number of power on cards he or she controls.\\r\\n✦Unless otherwise specified by an ability, a player may\\r\\nonly use tokens that are in game areas or on cards he or\\r\\nshe controls to pay costs.\\r\\n(1.5) Playing Events\\r\\nPlaying an event is defined as the process by which an event\\r\\nis revealed from its owner’s hand, its costs are paid and\\r\\ntargets chosen (if applicable), its effects resolve (or are\\r\\ncanceled), and it is placed in its owner’s discard pile.\\r\\nAfter an event’s costs are paid and its targets chosen (if\\r\\napplicable), that event leaves its controller’s hand. During\\r\\nsteps 6 and 7 of ability initiation (Rules Reference, page 10),\\r\\nthe event is in the process of being played, and is not\\r\\nconsidered to be in any specific out-of-play area. The event\\r\\nis placed in its owner’s discard pile after its effects are\\r\\nresolved in step 7.\\r\\nSome events have additional abilities that can only be\\r\\ntriggered while the event is not in its owner’s hand.\\r\\nTriggering such an ability is not considered to be “playing\\r\\nan event,” and does not require paying the event’s normal\\r\\ncost, only the cost of that ability.\\r\\nFor example: The Prince’s Plan (Blood and Gold, 16) has the\\r\\nability “Reaction: After you lose a challenge, pay 1 gold to return\\r\\nThe Prince’s Plan from your discard pile to your hand.” Triggering\\r\\nthis ability is not considered playing the event, so you need only\\r\\n2\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './agot_rag/GOT_FAQ_v4.1.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='pay the 1 gold described in the ability’s text, and not the 2 gold\\r\\ncost of playing The Prince’s Plan.\\r\\nIf an ability cancels the “effects of an event,” that ability can\\r\\ncancel the effects of any triggered ability on an event card.\\r\\n(1.6) Priority of Simultaneous Resolution\\r\\nIf two more constant abilities and/or lasting effects cannot\\r\\nbe applied simultaneously, the first player determines the\\r\\norder in which those constant abilities or lasting effects are\\r\\napplied. If the two abilities cannot coexist, the first player\\r\\ndetermines which one applies.\\r\\nThis determination is made only once, at the time the\\r\\nconflicting abilities would first affect the game state. This\\r\\nchoice is then maintained as long as the conflicting abilities\\r\\nremain active. If at any point an additional conflicting ability\\r\\nbecomes active, the first player may make a new\\r\\ndetermination.\\r\\nFor example: The first player has Varys’s Riddle (War of Five\\r\\nKings, 20) revealed, while that player’s opponent has Summer\\r\\nHarvest (War of Five Kings, 39) revealed, creating two conflicting\\r\\nvalues for the gold value on Summer Harvest. When the Summer\\r\\nHarvest player collects income, the first player will choose which\\r\\nvalue applies. If another effect later in the round references the\\r\\ngold value on Summer Harvest (for instance, Underground Vault\\r\\n(Blood and Gold, 46)), the same gold value will be used.\\r\\n(1.7) Paying Costs\\r\\nThe resolution of some effects (such as post-then effects or\\r\\ndelayed effects) requires that costs are paid after the\\r\\ninitiation of the effect. Such costs need not be verified when\\r\\ninitiating the ability and determining if its costs can be paid.\\r\\nIf such costs cannot be paid at the required time, that aspect\\r\\nof the effect fails to resolve.\\r\\n(1.8) Interrupts and Reactions to Abilities with “Then”\\r\\nEffects\\r\\nIf the effect text of an ability includes the word “then,” the\\r\\npre-then and post-then aspects of the effect share a common\\r\\nreaction window, which opens after the entire effect has\\r\\nresolved. Reactions to costs paid as part of the post-then\\r\\naspect of the ability also share this reaction window.\\r\\nInterrupts may be initiated during the resolution of such\\r\\neffects any time their triggering condition occurs, meaning\\r\\nthat the pre-then and post-then aspects of the ability may be\\r\\ninterrupted separately.\\r\\n(1.9) Card Abilities During Setup\\r\\nBecause setup occurs before the game begins, card abilities\\r\\nare not active during setup unless the ability specifically\\r\\nreferences setup or a timing point during setup (such as\\r\\n“after all agendas are announced”).\\r\\nFor example: Oldtown Scholar (Sands of Dorne, 41) cannot trigger\\r\\nits reaction after a player replenishes his or her hand during step\\r\\n10 of setup.\\r\\n2. CARD ABILITY INTERPRETATION\\r\\n(2.1) Cannot be {Variable}ed\\r\\nIf a card “cannot be {variable}ed,” where {variable} is\\r\\nsomething that would happen to the card such as “killed,”\\r\\n“discarded,” or “knelt,” that card cannot be chosen to be\\r\\n{variable}ed by a card ability or game effect that would\\r\\n{variable} the card. Further, a card that cannot be {variable}ed\\r\\nignores any non-targeting ability or game effect that would\\r\\n{variable} it.\\r\\nFor example: A card that “cannot be killed” cannot be chosen to\\r\\nbe killed to satisfy military challenge claim, cannot be chosen as\\r\\nthe target of an ability that would kill it, and it would ignore the\\r\\neffect of an ability that reads, “Kill each character in play.”\\r\\n(2.2) Delayed Effects and Immunity\\r\\nFor the purpose of determining whether or not a card is\\r\\nimmune to a delayed effect, the delayed effect is considered\\r\\nto be an effect of the card and card type that created it.\\r\\n(2.3) Referential Targets\\r\\nSome abilities require the choice of a target that is not\\r\\ndirectly affected by the ability—the target is instead chosen\\r\\nas a reference point while resolving the ability. When\\r\\nchoosing referential targets, a player is not bound by the rule\\r\\nthat a target is ineligible if the resolution of the effect would\\r\\nnot affect the chosen target.\\r\\nFor example: Wildfire Assault (Core, 26) allows each player to\\r\\nchoose up to 3 characters he or she controls. The effect then\\r\\nresolves on the characters not chosen. The targets chosen by this\\r\\nability are “referential targets,” and a player is not bound by the\\r\\nrule that the chosen targets are affected by Wildfire Assault’s\\r\\neffect, as this would be impossible: the chosen targets for this\\r\\nability are never affected by its effect.\\r\\n(2.4) Card Abilities & Out-of-Play Areas\\r\\nSome card abilities attempt to interact with a card while it is\\r\\nin a specific out-of-play area. Such an aspect of a card ability\\r\\ncannot interact with a card that is not in that specific\\r\\nout-of-play area. Note that some abilities implicitly refer to\\r\\nthe out-of-play area with which they can interact. For\\r\\ninstance, a reaction that interacts with a character after it’s\\r\\nkilled implicitly interacts with that character while it is in\\r\\nthe dead pile, and a reaction that interacts with a card after\\r\\nit’s discarded implicitly interacts with that card while it is in\\r\\nthe discard pile.\\r\\nFor example: Hot Pie (Westeros, 57) is discarded from a player’s\\r\\ndeck. An opponent plays Now My Watch Begins (Watchers on the\\r\\nWall, 23) to put Hot Pie into play. Although the reaction window\\r\\nto Hot Pie being discarded is still open, Crone of Vaes Dothrak’s\\r\\n(Westeros, 53) reaction can no longer be used on Hot Pie, as he is\\r\\nno longer in the discard pile.\\r\\n(2.5) References to Specific Positions in Game Areas\\r\\nAn ability that refers to a card in a specific position within a\\r\\ngame area (such as a player’s “revealed plot card” or the “top\\r\\ncard of a player’s deck”) refers to any card that occupies that\\r\\nposition while the ability is active, not just the card that\\r\\noccupies that position at the time the ability initiates. For\\r\\ninstance, if a lasting effect raises the claim value on a\\r\\nplayer’s revealed plot card by 1 until the end of the phase,\\r\\nand that player subsequently reveals a new plot card during\\r\\nthe phase, that lasting effect will remain active on the new\\r\\nplot card.\\r\\n(2.6) Timing of Terminal Condition Effects\\r\\nSome abilities create a delayed effect that will attempt to\\r\\ndrive a character from play whenever a certain condition is\\r\\nmet. The most common of these is the “terminal burn”\\r\\neffect, which kills a character if its STR is 0. Such an effect\\r\\nresolves automatically and immediately after the condition\\r\\noccurs, before any reactions to that moment may be used. If\\r\\na character with a terminal burn effect applied has its STR\\r\\nreduced to 0, the following timing sequence is observed:\\r\\n1) The STR-reduction effect becomes imminent.\\r\\n2) Interrupts to the STR-reduction effect may be used.\\r\\n3) The STR-reduction effect resolves, reducing the\\r\\ncharacter’s STR to 0.\\r\\n4) The “terminal burn” kill effect becomes imminent.\\r\\n3\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './agot_rag/GOT_FAQ_v4.1.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content=\"5) Interrupts to the kill effect may be used.\\r\\n6) The kill effect resolves.\\r\\n7) Reactions to the kill effect, or to the character’s STR being\\r\\nreduced, may be used.\\r\\nNote that at any point after Step 3, the character’s STR is 0.\\r\\n(2.7) The Word “You”\\r\\nIf a card ability uses the word “you” or “your,” that pronoun\\r\\ngenerally refers to the controller of the card.\\r\\nSome cards have abilities that may be triggered by a player\\r\\nother than the card’s controller. In the text of such abilities,\\r\\nthe word “you” or “your” refers to the player who is\\r\\ntriggering the ability.\\r\\n(2.8) Spending Gold\\r\\nIf a card ability allows a player to “spend” gold as if it were\\r\\nin his or her gold pool, that gold may be used any time that\\r\\nplayer could voluntarily pay or move gold from his or her\\r\\ngold pool. This includes paying costs of cards or abilities,\\r\\ngiving gold to an opponent, and moving gold using the\\r\\nbestow keyword.\\r\\n(2.9) The word “All”\\r\\nIf an effect causes a card to lose “all” of a given attribute\\r\\n(such as keywords, traits, or faction affiliations), that card\\r\\nloses each instance of each of those attributes. For instance,\\r\\nif an effect causes a character to “lose all Traits,” that\\r\\ncharacter will have no traits (even if another effect would\\r\\ncause it to have multiple instances of a given trait).\\r\\nFor example: A Hedge Knight (Westeros, 57) has the Knighted\\r\\n(Westeros, 58) attachment. If I Am No One (Flight of Crows, 82) is\\r\\nplayed on the Hedge Knight, it will no longer have the Knight\\r\\ntrait.\\r\\n(2.10) Characters contributing their STR\\r\\nA character may contribute its STR to a challenge in one of\\r\\ntwo ways: by participating in that challenge as an attacker or\\r\\ndefender; or, by the effects of a card ability. Some card\\r\\nabilities may cause a character to contribute its STR to a\\r\\nplayer’s side during a challenge without affecting the\\r\\nparticipating status of that character.\\r\\n✦When STR is compared to determine the winner of a\\r\\nchallenge (Step 4.2.2), the STR of any character that is\\r\\ncontributing its STR to a player’s side during that\\r\\nchallenge is added to that player’s total. Only add each\\r\\ncharacter’s STR once, even if a character contributes its\\r\\nSTR from multiple sources.\\r\\n✦A character can only contribute its STR to one player’s\\r\\nside during a challenge. If a character would contribute\\r\\nits STR to more than one player’s side, the most recent\\r\\neffect prevails. This includes a character contributing\\r\\nits STR to a challenge by becoming a participating\\r\\ncharacter.\\r\\n✦If an ability explicitly removes a character from a\\r\\nchallenge, that ability only affects the participating\\r\\nstatus of that character. It will not remove the STR\\r\\ncontribution of a character that is contributing its STR\\r\\nto a challenge by the effects of a card ability.\\r\\n✦Any card ability that explicitly says a character does not\\r\\ncontribute its STR to a challenge takes precedence over\\r\\nany card ability or framework effect that says the\\r\\nopposite.\\r\\nFor example: During a military challenge, Dennis uses the ability\\r\\nof Anya Waynwood (As High as Honor, 18) to have Richard's\\r\\nGrand Maester Pycelle (Core, 85) contribute his STR to Dennis's\\r\\nside. In response, Richard plays My Mind Is My Weapon (Kings of\\r\\nthe Isles, 28) to have Pycelle participate in the challenge and\\r\\ncontribute his STR to Richard's side instead. Finally, Dennis\\r\\nambushes Areo Hotah (Core, 103) and removes Pycelle from the\\r\\nchallenge. Since Anya's effect is now the most recent one, Pycelle\\r\\ncontributes his STR to Dennis's side when the winner of the\\r\\nchallenge is determined. (Note that Pycelle is not actually\\r\\nparticipating in the challenge at this point, so neither player can\\r\\ndraw a card for insight.)\\r\\n3. DYNAMIC SITUATIONS\\r\\n(3.1) Saving from a Terminal Condition\\r\\nWhen determining if a save effect has the potential to\\r\\nremedy an ongoing terminal condition, anticipate only the\\r\\napplication of all aspects of the effect that is producing the\\r\\nsave as well as all lasting effects and constant abilities that\\r\\nwould be affecting the card upon application of the effect.\\r\\nIf multiple effects would simultaneously attempt to drive a\\r\\ncharacter out of play due to a terminal condition, the first\\r\\nplayer chooses the order in which those effects resolve. If a\\r\\nsave used on the first removal effect also remedies the\\r\\nongoing terminal condition, the subsequent removal effect(s)\\r\\ntied to that terminal condition will not resolve.\\r\\nFor example: Dracarys! (Core, 176) is played on Dagmer Cleftjaw\\r\\n(Westeros, 111) while the plot Blood of the Dragon (Westeros, 75)\\r\\nis revealed. Dagmer’s STR is reduced to 0, and he is subject to the\\r\\n“ killed if its STR is 0” effects of both cards. The first player\\r\\ndecides to have Blood of the Dragon’s kill effect resolve first.\\r\\nDagmer’s controller interrupts that effect with Risen from the Sea\\r\\n(Core, 81), saving Dagmer and giving him +1 STR. Because\\r\\nDagmer’s STR is now 1, the kill effect from Dracarys! does not\\r\\nresolve, and Dagmer remains in play.\\r\\n(3.2) Saving from a Cost\\r\\nIf a card would leave play as part of the cost of initiating an\\r\\nability, that card cannot be saved.\\r\\nPlayer choices made as part of the initiating an ability/\\r\\nmarshaling a card process (Rules Reference, page 10),\\r\\nincluding the choosing of targets, are constrained to those\\r\\nthat were established as legal options in Step 1 of that\\r\\nprocess, where the legality of initiating the ability was\\r\\nchecked.\\r\\nIf a change in the game state between Step 1 and Step 7\\r\\ncreates a situation in which there are no legal targets at the\\r\\ntime targets are chosen, or a situation in which a choice\\r\\nmust be made but there are no valid options for that choice,\\r\\nthe ability is considered to resolve unsuccessfully. An event\\r\\nthat resolves unsuccessfully is placed in its owner’s discard\\r\\npile.\\r\\n(3.4) Challenge Icons\\r\\nA character is considered to have a challenge icon or to not\\r\\nhave that icon. A single character that has and/or is gaining\\r\\nthe same challenge icon from multiple sources functions as\\r\\nif it has one instance of that icon.\\r\\n(3.5) Multiple Copies of the Same Agenda\\r\\nA player cannot run more than 1 copy of each different\\r\\nagenda (by title), even in situations where they are allowed to\\r\\nrun multiple agendas.\\r\\nCARD LEGALITY\\r\\nFor most events, a product is legal from the time of its\\r\\nrelease until the time of its rotation (if applicable).\\r\\nTournament Organizers have authority to determine the\\r\\n4\\n\"),\n",

For a current list of\\r\\nlegal product, see the GOT website, here:\\r\\nagot.cards/category/global-operations-team/restricted-list-fa\\r\\nq\\r\\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\\r\\nThis section provides answers to a number of common\\r\\nquestions that are asked about the game. The entries are\\r\\npresented in a “question and answer” format, with the\\r\\nnewest questions at the end of the list.\\r\\nWhich abilities does Catelyn Stark (Core, 143) prevent an\\r\\nopponent from using?\\r\\nCatelyn prevents an opponent from using triggered card\\r\\nabilities that he or she would initiate. A triggered ability is\\r\\nindicated by a bold timing trigger, such as Action, Interrupt,\\r\\nReaction, Dominance Action, and so forth. Catelyn\\r\\nprevents an opponent from initiating such bold-faced\\r\\nabilities. However, Forced abilities and When Revealed\\r\\nabilities are initiated automatically by the game (as opposed\\r\\nto being initiated by the player who controls the card), so\\r\\nCatelyn does not prevent these two classes of triggered\\r\\nabilities. Additionally, using a duplicate is defined as a\\r\\ntriggered game ability (as opposed to a triggered card ability),\\r\\nand therefore Catelyn does not prevent the use of duplicates.\\r\\nFinally, any ability that is not prefaced with a bold timing\\r\\ntrigger (such as a keyword, like ambush) is not considered a\\r\\ntriggered ability, and is not prevented by Catelyn’s text.\\r\\nWhen can I trigger Melisandre’s (Core, 47) reaction to “playing” a\\r\\nR’hllor event such as Seen in Flames (Core, 64)—before or after\\r\\nthe effect of Seen in Flames occurs?\\r\\nThe act of playing an event entails paying its costs, resolving\\r\\nits effects (or having those effects canceled), and placing the\\r\\nevent in its owner’s discard pile. Reactions to playing an\\r\\nevent may only be triggered after this process is complete.\\r\\nTherefore, the effect of Seen in Flames is resolved before\\r\\nMelisandre’s reaction to playing the event may be triggered.\\r\\nWhile I am in the process of playing a Hand’s Judgment (Core, 45)\\r\\nfrom my hand, and my opponent uses another event card to\\r\\nattempt to cancel my Hand’s Judgment, can I attempt to play that\\r\\nsame copy of my Hand’s Judgement a second time to cancel my\\r\\nopponent’s event?\\r\\nNo. At the time the opponent’s cancel would initiate, Hand’s\\r\\nJudgment is in the process of being played and is no longer\\r\\nin your hand. Therefore, you are unable to play that copy of\\r\\nHand’s Judgment. (You could, however, play another copy of\\r\\nthe card.)\\r\\nCan Nymeria Sand (Westeros, 35) be used to cause a character to\\r\\nlose a challenge icon it does not currently possess, so that each of\\r\\nmy Sand Snake characters can gain that icon?\\r\\nYes. There are no targeting restrictions on Nymeria Sand’s\\r\\nability beyond “choose an opponent’s character,” so any\\r\\nopponent’s character is an eligible choice. If you choose an\\r\\nicon type that the chosen character does not possess, a\\r\\nlasting effect causing that character to lose one instance of\\r\\nthat icon is still applied to that character for the duration of\\r\\nthe effect. (This means that the character would now have to\\r\\ngain an additional instance of the icon type to function as if\\r\\nit had the icon.) Finally, the subsequent gaining of that icon\\r\\ntype by each of your Sand Snake characters is not dependent\\r\\nupon the opponent’s character losing a functional version of\\r\\nthe icon.\\r\\nIf I place an attachment in setup that would have a legal target\\r\\namong the other cards I have placed, can I, after revealing setup\\r\\ncards, decide to attach it to a legal target in an opponent’s setup?\\r\\nNo. Setup cards may only be attached to revealed cards you\\r\\ncontrol.\\r\\nWhen I am attaching my cards during setup, do I attach them all\\r\\nat once or one at a time?\\r\\nAll of a player’s attachments are attached simultaneously\\r\\nduring setup. While placing cards for setup, you cannot use\\r\\none attachment to create a condition in which another\\r\\nattachment is legally attached. In other words, you cannot\\r\\nsetup the Knighted (Westeros, 58) attachment on a\\r\\nnon-Knight character so that you can also setup the Mare In\\r\\nHeat (Westeros, 44) attachment on the same character.\\r\\nIf upon completion of attaching cards during setup one\\r\\nattachment has created a game state in which another\\r\\nattachment is illegally attached, immediately discard the\\r\\nillegal attachment.\\r\\nIf I win a challenge in which I control two attacking Knight\\r\\ncharacters and one of them is targeted by Ghaston Grey (Core,\\r\\n116), returning it to my hand and leaving me with one attacking\\r\\nKnight character, may I subsequently play Lady Sansa’s Rose\\r\\n(Westeros, 24) by virtue of that single Knight who is now attacking\\r\\nalone?\\r\\nYes, you may. Lady Sansa’s Rose reads “...in which you\\r\\ncontrol a Knight character that is attacking alone,” and the\\r\\ncheck on “is attacking alone” is made at the time the event\\r\\nwould be played.\\r\\nIf I play a limited card as a duplicate, does it count as my limited\\r\\ncard for the round?\\r\\nNo. When you marshal a card as a duplicate, it is not\\r\\nconsidered to have any of its printed keywords, including the\\r\\nlimited keyword.\\r\\nI am declaring two copies of the card Wolves of the North (Wolves\\r\\nof the North, 6) as attackers. Can each copy choose the same\\r\\ntarget for stealth when I declare stealth targets?\\r\\nThe timing of declaring stealth targets is considered to be\\r\\nsimultaneous with the declaration of the challenge,\\r\\nopponent, and attackers. Each stealth target, however, is\\r\\ndeclared independently, and each Wolves of the North may\\r\\nselect the same target for its stealth ability.\\r\\nHow does the Master of Whispers (Core, 206) title ability work\\r\\nwith claim replacement or adjustment effects such as Trial by\\r\\nCombat (Westeros, 90), Vengeance for Elia (Westeros, 96), and\\r\\nMirri Maz Duur (Westeros, 93)?\\r\\nThe Master of Whispers ability is not itself a claim\\r\\nreplacement ability, and therefore functions alongside claim\\r\\nreplacement effects as much as it is able, based on the\\r\\nlanguage of the particular effect in question.\\r\\nFor Trial by Combat, each opponent you choose will suffer\\r\\nthe military claim.\\r\\nFor Vengeance for Elia, the player who lost the challenge (if\\r\\nThe Masters of Whispers player decides the loser of the\\r\\nchallenge will be resolving claim) can cause a different\\r\\nopponent to suffer that claim for him or her, and the\\r\\nattacker may also still resolve the claim against some or all\\r\\nof the other opponents as well. Note that if a player who is\\r\\n5\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './agot_rag/GOT_FAQ_v4.1.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='already responsible for satisfying claim (due to Master of\\r\\nWhispers) is chosen as the target of Vengeance for Elia, that\\r\\nplayer still only applies the claim result once, and this\\r\\nsatisfies both obligations.\\r\\nFor Mirri Maz Duur, her ability requires that you choose one\\r\\ncharacter controlled by the losing opponent, and kills that\\r\\ncharacter. As only one character is chosen to be killed by\\r\\nthis ability, the resolution of Mirri’s claim against other\\r\\nopponents does nothing, and there is no interaction between\\r\\nthese two cards.\\r\\nIf I play Dragon Sight (Wolves of the North, 36) in the challenge\\r\\naction window before declaring defenders, will any defenders that\\r\\nare subsequently declared be affected by the Dragon Sight effect?\\r\\nNo. If an ability creates a lasting effect on a set of cards, it\\r\\nonly affects the cards that are eligible at the time the event\\r\\ncard is played.\\r\\nConversely, if a character that had been participating in a\\r\\nchallenge and affected by Dragon Sight is somehow removed\\r\\nfrom the challenge, the lasting effect remains in effect on\\r\\nthat character until the end of the challenge, regardless of its\\r\\nstatus as participating or not.\\r\\nHow do multiple “take control” effects work? For instance, if one\\r\\nopponent gains control of my character with Take the Black (Core,\\r\\n139), and then another opponent takes control of that same\\r\\ncharacter with Ward (Westeros, 102), what happens to the\\r\\ncharacter if Ward is discarded?\\r\\nUpon the expiration or cessation of a control change effect,\\r\\ncontrol of the card reverts back to the player with the\\r\\nnext-most recent take control effect that would affect on the\\r\\ncard. (If no player possesses a control effect that would affect\\r\\nthe card, control reverts back to the card’s owner.) In this\\r\\nexample, when the Ward card leaves play, control of the\\r\\ncharacter reverts back to the player who had gained control\\r\\nof it with Take the Black.\\r\\nIf I win a challenge in which I control both Ser Gregor Clegane\\r\\n(Westeros, 49) and Euron Crow’s Eye (Core, 69), which player\\r\\nchooses the order in which their pillage abilities resolve?\\r\\nAs the controller of the two characters, you choose the order\\r\\nin which their pillage abilities resolve. Although the first\\r\\nplayer determines the order in which keywords are\\r\\nprocessed, by type, the first player does not determine the\\r\\norder in which keywords resolve within each type. Because\\r\\neach instance of pillage is optional, the controller of the\\r\\ncharacters with pillage chooses in which order the pillage\\r\\nabilities resolve.\\r\\nWhat happens if a character gains a challenge resolution keyword\\r\\nwhile another challenge resolution keyword is being processed?\\r\\nEach keyword type can only be processed once during\\r\\nchallenge resolution. If a character gains a keyword after\\r\\nthat keyword has already been processed, that character’s\\r\\ninstance of the keyword will not resolve. However, if a\\r\\ncharacter gains a keyword that has not yet been processed,\\r\\nor is currently being processed, that instance of the keyword\\r\\nwill be able to resolve. Note that a keyword can only be\\r\\nprocessed if a relevant instance of that keyword is present in\\r\\nthe challenge.\\r\\nIf I reveal Varys’s Riddle (War of Five Kings, 20) and my opponent\\r\\nreveals Summer Harvest (War of Five Kings, 39), what will the\\r\\nbase gold value on Summer Harvest be?\\r\\nVarys’s Riddle allows you to initiate the ability on Summer\\r\\nHarvest as if you had just revealed it. This means that\\r\\nSummer Harvest’s ability will trigger twice: one will be the\\r\\n“original” version triggered by your opponent, while the\\r\\nother will be a version “as if you had just revealed it,” which\\r\\nchanges who is an eligible target for “Choose an opponent.”\\r\\nThese abilities will each attempt to define the gold value on\\r\\nSummer Harvest: the “original” will look at the printed gold\\r\\nvalue on Varys’s Riddle (which is 5) and define its base gold\\r\\nvalue as 7, while the other will look at the printed gold value\\r\\non Summer Harvest (which is X, treated as 0) and define its\\r\\nbase gold value as 2. Because these two lasting effects cannot\\r\\nbe applied simultaneously, the first player chooses the order\\r\\nin which to apply them, and the base gold value on Summer\\r\\nHarvest will either be 2 or 7 based on the first player’s\\r\\nchoice.\\r\\nIf I use At Prince Doran’s Behest (Sands of Dorne, 46) to reveal\\r\\nanother plot with a when revealed ability, and my opponent also\\r\\nhas a plot with a when revealed ability waiting to initiate, which\\r\\nplot’s ability initiates first?\\r\\nThe first player chooses the order in which the remaining\\r\\nwhen revealed abilities initiate. The newly revealed plot does\\r\\nnot have any special timing priority--it is simply treated as\\r\\nanother plot card with a when revealed ability that needs to\\r\\nbe initiated as part of step 1.3.III (“Initiate When Revealed\\r\\nabilities”). Note that initiative has already been compared in\\r\\nstep I, so there will be no new initiative comparison when\\r\\nthe new plot is revealed in step III (i.e. the first player will\\r\\nnot change).\\r\\nWhat card effects are covered by the constant ability on Daenerys\\r\\nTargaryen (Flight of Crows, 93)?\\r\\nDaenerys Targaryen’s ability prevents her STR from being\\r\\nreduced by card effects. If a card effect applies a STR\\r\\nmodifier that would reduce her STR, that modifier is\\r\\nignored. This includes subtractive modifiers and halving\\r\\nmodifiers, as well as any modifier that would “set” her STR\\r\\nto a value that is lower than her base STR.\\r\\nHow does Tycho Nestoris (Dance of Shadows, 37) work in\\r\\nsituations where all of a player’s opponents are eliminated (for\\r\\ninstance, due to running out of cards in their deck)? How does he\\r\\nwork in tournament games that go to time?\\r\\nIf a player controls Tycho Nestoris and his “You cannot win\\r\\nthe game” ability is active, nothing within the game rules\\r\\ncan cause that player to win the game. If all of that player’s\\r\\nopponents are eliminated, the game ends with no winner. (In\\r\\na tournament, this is recorded as a loss for each player.)\\r\\nIf a tournament game goes to time with a player controlling\\r\\nTycho at 15 or more power, that player’s opponent receives a\\r\\nmodified win, as that opponent is considered to be closer to\\r\\ntheir victory condition. If a tournament game goes to time\\r\\nwith both players controlling Tycho, both players receive a\\r\\nloss.\\r\\nIf a player controls Tycho at the end of a Melee game, the\\r\\nbest placement that player can achieve is 2nd place. If a\\r\\ntournament Melee game goes to time and a player\\r\\ncontrolling Tycho has the highest power total, the player\\r\\nwith the next-highest power total is the winner of the game.\\r\\nTycho does not prevent a player from winning if that player’s\\r\\nopponent concedes the game.\\r\\nCan The Hand’s Judgment (Core, 45) be used to cancel an event\\r\\nwith a “-” cost?\\r\\nYes. The Hand’s Judgment has a cost of X, where X is\\r\\ndefined as the printed cost of the event being canceled. If\\r\\nThe Hand’s Judgment is used to cancel a “—” event, which\\r\\n6\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './agot_rag/GOT_FAQ_v4.1.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='has no printed cost, that X will be undefined. An undefined\\r\\nX value defaults to 0, therefore The Hand’s Judgment can be\\r\\nplayed for 0 gold.\\r\\nHow does Scouting Vessel (Kings of the Isles, 20) interact with\\r\\nother reactions and interrupts to discarding a card using pillage,\\r\\nsuch as Asha Greyjoy (Flight of Crows, 51) and Tywin Lannister\\r\\n(Lions of Casterly Rock, 6)?\\r\\nScouting Vessel’s ability is a replacement effect that replaces\\r\\n“a card being discarded using pillage” with “3 cards being\\r\\ndiscarded using pillage.” If Scouting Vessel is used on the\\r\\ncard Asha Greyjoy discards using pillage, Asha is considered\\r\\nto have discarded 3 cards using pillage and her reaction can\\r\\nbe triggered 3 times.\\r\\nIf Tywin Lannister’s ability is triggered on a card discarded\\r\\nusing pillage, and then Scouting Vessel is triggered,\\r\\nScouting Vessel’s ability will be the one that resolves\\r\\nbecause it is the most recently applied replacement effect. If\\r\\nScouting Vessel’s ability is triggered first, Tywin Lannister’s\\r\\nability cannot then be triggered, because the triggering\\r\\ncondition of “exactly 1 card” being discarded from a player’s\\r\\ndeck is no longer imminent.\\r\\nMy opponent plays No Surprises (King’s Landing, 22), which states\\r\\nthat I cannot “bring cards out of shadows.” Can I still use the\\r\\nability on Starfall Spy (Dance of Shadows, 115) to put a card\\r\\ndirectly into play from shadows?\\r\\nNo. Any effect that causes a card to come out of shadows is\\r\\nconsidered to be “bringing a card out of shadows,” including\\r\\neffects like Starfall Spy that put a card into play from\\r\\nshadows. Therefore, such effects are prevented by the effect\\r\\nof No Surprises.\\r\\nCan I use “A Cask of Ale” (Fury of the Storm, 23) to move power\\r\\nto a plot card, a melee title, or an agenda?\\r\\n“A Cask of Ale” can move power to a player’s revealed plot\\r\\ncard or melee title, as each of those cards is considered to be\\r\\nin play under that player’s control. “A Cask of Ale” cannot\\r\\nmove power to an agenda, as agendas are not in play.\\r\\nIf my opponent has Baelor Blacktyde (King’s Landing, 11) in play\\r\\nand I play Emissary of the Hightower (House of Thorns, 11),\\r\\nchoosing an event of which I have a single copy in my discard pile,\\r\\nwill Baelor’s ability prevent me from playing that event?\\r\\nNo. Baelor Blacktyde’s ability will not prevent you from\\r\\nplaying an event from your discard pile if there are no other\\r\\ncopies of that event in your discard pile.\\r\\nDoes the effect on Time of Plenty (Lions of Casterly Rock, 51)\\r\\nincrease the number of cards drawn by a card effect triggered\\r\\nduring the draw phase?\\r\\nNo. Card effects like Time of Plenty that modify the number\\r\\nof cards a player draws “in the draw phase” only modify the 2\\r\\ncards drawn as part of framework event step 2.2, “Draw.”\\r\\nCard effects that occur during the draw phase are not\\r\\nmodified.\\r\\nIf I have a facedown card attached to Dothraki Handmaiden\\r\\n(Dragons of the East, 14) and use the Handmaiden’s constant\\r\\nability to marshal that card, is it considered to have entered play?\\r\\nNo. The card is already in play as an attachment on Dothraki\\r\\nHandmaiden, so marshaling it will not cause it to “enter\\r\\nplay.” You will not be able to trigger any effects that occur\\r\\nwhen a card “enters play.”\\r\\nCan I name a plot card with The Iron Throne (Long May He\\r\\nReign, 117) to prevent my opponent from revealing that plot\\r\\nduring the plot phase?\\r\\nNo. Plot cards are not marshaled, played, or put into play, so\\r\\nThe Iron Throne does not prevent a player from revealing a\\r\\nplot card with the chosen name.\\r\\nQUICK REFERENCE\\r\\nThis section provides standard play information in an\\r\\nabbreviated, quick-reference format that can be helpful in\\r\\nclarifying some common situations in the game.\\r\\nChallenge Application Timing Sequence\\r\\nWhen applying the results of a challenge, observe the\\r\\nfollowing steps, which can be easily remembered with the\\r\\nmnemonic device “D.U.C.K.”\\r\\n1) Determine challenge result.\\r\\n2) Unopposed.\\r\\n3) Claim.\\r\\n4) Keywords.\\r\\nEnd of Phase Timing Sequence\\r\\nNumerous abilities reference the end of a phase in a variety\\r\\nof ways. The following is a breakdown of how such\\r\\nsequences are observed.\\r\\n1) Interrupts to the end of phase may be used.\\r\\n2) “Until the end of the phase” lasting abilities (and “during\\r\\nthe X phase” abilities) expire. This step is the precise\\r\\nmoment at which the phase ends, and anything that occurs\\r\\nas a result of the next two steps occurs outside of the phase.\\r\\n3) “At the end of the phase” delayed effects resolve.\\r\\n4) Reactions to the end of the phase may be used.\\r\\nThe above can be generalized and used when referring to the\\r\\nend of other periods, such as the end of a challenge or the\\r\\nend of a round.\\r\\n7\\n'),\n",

The game changed while I\\r\\nlay rotting in my bed, and no one will tell me the rules.\\r\\n— George R.R. Martin, A Song of Ice and Fire\\r\\nThis document is intended as the definitive source for rules information, but does not teach players how to play\\r\\nthe game. Players should first read the Learn to Play book in its entirety and use this Rules Reference as needed\\r\\nwhile playing the game.\\r\\nThe majority of this guide consists of the glossary, which provides an alphabetical listing of terms and situations a\\r\\nplayer might encounter during a game. This section should be the first destination for players who have a rules\\r\\nquestion.\\r\\nThe latter part of this guide contains two appendices. The first appendix provides detailed timing diagrams that\\r\\nillustrate the structure of an entire game round, as well as a detailed explanation on how to handle each game step\\r\\npresented in those diagrams. The second provides a detailed anatomy of each cardtype.\\r\\nThe Golden Rules\\r\\nIf the text of this Rules Reference directly contradicts the text of the Learn to Play book, the text of the Rules\\r\\nReference takes precedence.\\r\\nIf the text of a card directly contradicts the text of either the Rules Reference or the Learn to Play book, the text of\\r\\nthe card takes precedence.\\r\\nGlossary\\r\\nThe following is an alphabetical list of entries for game rules, terms, and situations that may occur during play.\\r\\nAbilities\\r\\nAn ability is the special game text that a card contributes to the game. Card abilities fall into one of the following\\r\\ntypes: actions, constant abilities, interrupts, keywords, reactions, or when revealed abilities.\\r\\nThe initiation of action, interrupt, and reaction abilities is optional. The word \"may\" also incorporates a player\\r\\noption into the resolution of an ability. The player who controls the card on which an optional ability exists\\r\\ndetermines whether or not he or she wishes to use that ability at the appropriate time.\\r\\nThe application or initiation of the following types of abilities is mandatory: constant abilities, when revealed\\r\\nabilities, forced interrupt abilities, and forced reaction abilities.\\r\\nThe initiation of any keyword which uses the word \"may\" in its keyword description is optional. The\\r\\napplication of all other keywords is mandatory.\\r\\nCard abilities only interact with, and can only target, cards that are in play, unless the ability text specifically\\r\\nrefers to an out of play area or element. Card abilities on characters, locations, and attachments can only be\\r\\ninitiated or afect the game from an in play area unless they specifically refer to being used from an out of\\r\\nplay area, or require that the card be out of play for the ability to resolve. Event cards and agenda cards\\r\\nimplicitly interact with the game from an out of play area, as established by the rules of their cardtypes.\\r\\nA card ability can only be initiated if its efect has the potential to change the game state. This potential is\\r\\nassessed without taking into account the consequences of the cost payment or any other ability interactions.\\r\\nA card ability can only be initiated if its cost (after modifiers) has the potential to be paid in full.\\r\\nRelated: Actions, Efects, Constant Abilities, Costs, Delayed Efects, Forced Interrupts/Forced Reactions, In Play and\\r\\nOut of Play, Interrupts, Keywords, Lasting Efects, Reactions, Triggered Abilities, When Revealed\\r\\nActions\\r\\nAn action is a triggered ability that contains the boldface \"Action:\" precursor. These abilities can only be initiated\\r\\nby a player during an action window. For details on when action windows occur during each round, see the timing\\r\\ncharts in Appendix I.\\r\\nSome Action abilities have a phase name as a qualifier to the word \"Action.\" Such abilities are still considered\\r\\nAction abilities, with the restriction that they can only be initiated during an action window in the specified phase.\\r\\nAn action must be resolved completely before the next action can be initiated.\\r\\nRelated: In Play and Out of Play\\r\\nActive Player\\r\\nIn some phases, the game creates an active player, who is granted permission to perform a specified task.\\r\\nDuring the marshaling phase, the active player collects income and is also permitted to marshal character,\\r\\nlocation, attachment, and duplicate cards from his or her hand.\\r\\nDuring the challenges phase, the active player is permitted to initiate challenges.\\r\\nRelated: Marshaling Phase, Challenges Phase\\r\\nAgainst\\r\\nDuring a challenge, the attacking player and the defending player are considered to be taking part in the challenge\\r\\n\"against\" each other.\\r\\nAgenda Cards\\r\\nAgenda cards are placed alongside a player\\'s faction card, and provide specialized abilities and limitations for his or\\r\\nher deck. A player may use a single agenda card in conjunction with his or her faction card when assembling a\\r\\ndeck. The agenda card starts the game next to a player\\'s faction card and is revealed along with the faction card\\r\\nduring setup.\\r\\nAgenda cards are not considered \"in play.\" Their text afects the game state from the out of play area while\\r\\nthey are active beside a player\\'s faction card.\\r\\nCards with the printed agenda cardtype cannot be removed from the game by other card abilities.\\r\\nRelated: In Play and Out of Play, Deckbuilding\\r\\nAmbush (X)\\r\\nAmbush is a keyword ability. A player may, as a player action during the challenges phase, pay gold equal to the (X)\\r\\nvalue of a card with ambush to put that card into play from his or her hand. A card that enters play using ambush\\r\\nis not considered to have been marshaled.\\r\\nIf a card has multiple instances of ambush, each with a diferent (X) value, the player controlling the card may\\r\\nchoose which instance of ambush is used to put the card into play.\\r\\nRelated: Keywords, Put into Play\\r\\nAssault\\r\\nAssault is a keyword ability. When a character with assault is declared as an attacker in a challenge, that character’s\\r\\ncontroller may choose a location with lower printed cost controlled by the defending player. The chosen location is\\r\\nconsidered to be targeted by assault. Until the end of the challenge, treat it as if its printed text box were blank\\r\\n(except for Traits). Unless otherwise stated by a card ability, only one location may be targeted using assault in\\r\\neach challenge. When a player wins a challenge in which they control 1 or more attacking characters with assault,\\r\\nany location that was targeted by assault in that challenge is knelt.\\r\\nThe target for assault is chosen at the same time as targets for stealth are chosen, before reactions to the\\r\\nchallenge being initiated can be triggered. If a challenge is redirected using the Crown Regent melee title, the\\r\\nattacking player may choose a new target for assault. The previously chosen target is not considered to have\\r\\nbeen targeted by assault and remains unafected.\\r\\nOnce a challenge is initiated, a location targeted by assault will remain blanked for the duration of the\\r\\nchallenge (until step 4.2.6), even if the defending player wins the challenge, or if any attacking character with\\r\\nassault is removed from the challenge or loses the assault keyword. If a location that was targeted by assault\\r\\nleaves play during a challenge, all efects of assault on that card expire.\\r\\nWhen a player wins a challenge in which they control 1 or more attacking characters with assault, any\\r\\nlocation that was targeted by assault in that challenge is knelt. This happens immediately after the winner of\\r\\nthe challenge is determined, before any reactions (forced or otherwise) to winning or losing that challenge\\r\\ncan be initiated. For the location to be knelt, the only check that is made is whether there is a character with\\r\\nassault participating on the attacking player’s side. It does not matter whether that specific character\\r\\ntargeted that location using assault when the challenge was initiated.\\r\\nIf a location is kneeling, or if its printed text box is already treated as if it were blank, that location is still an\\r\\neligible target for assault. A location that \"cannot be knelt by assault\" may still be targeted by assault, but it\\r\\nwill not be knelt if the attacking player wins the challenge. A location that \"cannot be targeted by assault\" is\\r\\nnot an eligible choice when the assault target is chosen.\\r\\nAn example of how assault may be used during a challenge: Kristin initiates a challenge against Magnus and declares\\r\\nDagmer Cleftjaw (Westeros, 111) and The Iron Fleet (For the Realm, 4) as attackers. Since The Iron Fleet has the assault\\r\\nkeyword, Kristin chooses The Wall (Core, 137) as the target of assault. The printed text box of The Wall is now treated as if\\r\\nit were blank, so it no longer provides +1 STR to each \\ue606 character Magnus controls. Magnus determines that he cannot\\r\\nsuccessfully defend the challenge. He would like The Wall to remain standing so that he could trigger its Interrupt ability\\r\\nat the end of the phase. He plays Nightmares (Westeros, 99) on The Iron Fleet, removing its assault keyword. In order to\\r\\nkneel The Wall, Kristin knows that she needs to control a participating character with assault at the point when the\\r\\nwinner of the challenge is determined, so she uses Silence (Kings of the Isles, 16) to put Foamdrinker (For the Realm, 5)\\r\\ninto play from her hand. Dagmer Cleftjaw now gains assault from Foamdrinker’s constant ability. When Kristin wins the\\r\\nchallenge, The Wall is knelt.\\r\\nAttachment Cards\\r\\nAttachment cards represent weapons, armor, items, skills, conditions, and titles. These cards enter play standing\\r\\nand attached to another card or game element, and remain in play unless removed by an ability, or unless the\\r\\nattached card leaves play. An attachment cannot enter play if there is no eligible card or game element to which it\\r\\ncan attach.\\r\\nAn attachment can only attach to a character, unless otherwise specified by the attachment\\'s text.\\r\\nThere is no limit on the number of attachments that may be attached to a card or game element.\\r\\nIf a card to which an attachment is attached leaves play, return the attachment to its owner\\'s hand. This\\r\\noccurs simultaneously with the attached card leaving play.\\r\\nIf a situation arises in which an attachment is not legally attached, discard the attachment.\\r\\nAn attachment a player controls remains under his or her control even if the card or game element to which\\r\\nit is attached is under an opponent\\'s control.\\r\\nAn attachment card stands and kneels independently of the card to which it is attached.\\r\\nRelated: Ownership and Control\\r\\nAttacker, Attacking Character, Attacking Player\\r\\nThe term \"attacking character\" refers to a character that is participating in a challenge on the side of the player\\r\\nwho initiated the challenge. The term \"attacker\" is also used as shorthand for \"attacking character.\"\\r\\nThe term \"attacking player\" refers to the player that initiated the challenge that is currently resolving.\\r\\nRelated: Challenges Phase, Defender, Participating\\r\\nBase Value\\r\\nThe value of a quantity before any modifiers are applied. For most quantities, it is also the printed value.\\r\\nRelated: Printed, Modifiers\\r\\nBestow\\r\\nBestow is a keyword ability. When a card with bestow (X) enters play, the card\\'s controller may move up to X gold\\r\\nfrom his or her gold pool to that card. This decision is made immediately upon the card entering play, after\\r\\nresolving any interrupts to the card entering play but prior to triggering any reactions (forced or otherwise) to the\\r\\ncard entering play.\\r\\nWhen placing gold using bestow, a player may choose any amount of gold, up to the (X) value of the card\\r\\nwith bestow. (For example, when a card with \"bestow (2)\" enters play, its controller may move 0, 1, or 2 gold from\\r\\nhis or her gold pool to that card.)\\r\\nGold on a card is not in its controller\\'s gold pool. Game steps and abilities that use or interact with gold in a\\r\\nplayer\\'s gold pool do not interact with gold on cards.\\r\\nWhen gold is discarded from a card with bestow, it is returned to the treasury.\\r\\nBlank\\r\\nIf a card\\'s printed text box is considered \"blank\" by an ability, that text box is treated as if it did not have any of its\\r\\nprinted content. Text and/or icons gained from another source are not blanked.\\r\\nA card\\'s text box includes: traits, keywords, card text and abilities, and non-challenge icons (such as gold,\\r\\ninitiative, and reserve modifiers).\\r\\nRelated: Printed\\r\\nCancel\\r\\nSome card abilities (usually interrupt abilities) can \"cancel\" other card or game efects. Cancel abilities interrupt the\\r\\ninitiation of an efect, and prevent the efect from initiating. Because of this, cancel abilities have timing priority\\r\\nover all other interrupts to the efect that is attempting to initiate.\\r\\nWhen an efect is canceled, that efect is no longer imminent, and further interrupts (including cancels)\\r\\ncannot be initiated in reference to the canceled efect.\\r\\nWhen the efects of an ability are canceled, the ability is still considered to have been used, and any costs\\r\\nhave still been paid.\\r\\nIf the efects of an event card are canceled, the card is still considered to have been played, and it is still\\r\\nplaced in its owner\\'s discard pile.\\r\\nRelated: Costs, Initiating Abilities, Interrupts, Limits and Maxima, Triggering Condition\\r\\nCannot\\r\\nThe word \"cannot\" is absolute, and cannot be countermanded by other abilities.\\r\\nCardtypes\\r\\nIf an ability causes a card to change its cardtype (such as an event card that changes into an attachment), it\\r\\nloses all other cardtypes it might possess and functions as would any card of the new cardtype.\\r\\nChallenge Icons\\r\\nThese icons appear on most character cards and indicate which challenge types the character may be declared for\\r\\nas an attacker or defender. The challenge icons are:\\r\\nChallenge Graphic Icon In Text\\r\\nMilitary \\ue605 [military]\\r\\nIntrigue \\ue602 [intrigue]\\r\\nPower \\ue607 [power]\\r\\nChallenges Phase\\r\\nSee Appendix I, \"4. Challenges phase\".\\r\\nCharacter Cards\\r\\nCharacter cards represent the lords, ladies, knights, armies, mercenaries, creatures, and other personalities and\\r\\ngroups one might encounter in the A Song of Ice and Fire setting. These cards enter play in the front row of a\\r\\nplayer\\'s play area and remain in play unless removed by an ability or game efect.\\r\\nChoose\\r\\nThe word \"choose\" indicates that one or more targets must be chosen in order to resolve an ability.\\r\\nRelated: Target\\r\\nClaim or Claim Value\\r\\nClaim represents the consequences a player must face upon losing a challenge as the defending player.\\r\\nThe claim value on a player\\'s revealed plot card (which incorporates all relevant claim modifiers) determines the\\r\\npotency of each challenge that player initiates if he or she wins the challenge.\\r\\nClaim value determines: how many diferent characters the losing opponent must kill (for a [military] challenge),\\r\\nhow many cards are discarded from the losing opponent\\'s hand (for an [intrigue] challenge), or how much power is\\r\\ntaken from the losing opponent\\'s faction card (for a [power] challenge).\\r\\nRelated: Intrigue Claim, Military Claim, Power Claim\\r\\nConstant Abilities\\r\\nA constant ability is any non-keyword ability whose text contains no boldface precursor defining its ability type. A\\r\\nconstant ability becomes active as soon as its card enters play and remains active while that card is in play.\\r\\nSome constant abilities continuously seek a specific condition (denoted by words such as \"during,\" \"if,\" or\\r\\n\"while\"). The efects of such abilities are active any time the specified condition is met.\\r\\nIf multiple instances of the same constant ability are in play, each instance afects the game state.\\r\\nRelated: In Play and Out of Play\\r\\nControl\\r\\nSee \"Ownership and Control\".\\r\\nCopy (of a card)\\r\\nA copy of a card is defined by title: any other card that shares the same title is considered a copy, regardless of\\r\\ncardtype, text, artwork, or any other characteristic of the card(s).\\r\\nRelated: Deckbuilding, Ownership and Control, Unique Cards, Self-Referential Text\\r\\nCosts\\r\\nA card\\'s gold cost is the numerical value that must be paid to marshal or play the card.\\r\\nSome card abilities are presented in a \"do X to do Y\" construct. In such a construct, the \"do X\" aspect (preceding the\\r\\nword \"to\") is a cost, and the \"do Y\" aspect (following the word \"to\") is an efect.\\r\\nAn opponent\\'s game elements may not be used to pay a cost.\\r\\nIf a cost requires a game element that is not in play, the player paying the cost may only use game elements\\r\\nthat are in his or her out of play areas and/or gold pool to pay the cost.\\r\\nIf multiple costs for a single card or ability require payment, those costs must be paid simultaneously.\\r\\nIf any part of a cost payment is prevented, once all costs that can be paid are paid, the process of initiating\\r\\nthe ability or marshaling/playing the card immediately ends without further resolution. (The card remains\\r\\nunplayed in its owner\\'s hand.)\\r\\nAn ability cannot initiate (and therefore its costs cannot be paid) if the resolution of its efect will not change\\r\\nthe game state.\\r\\nRelated: In Play and Out of Play, Ownership and Control\\r\\nDead Pile\\r\\nThe dead pile is an out of play area. It is distinct from the discard pile.\\r\\nAny time a character in play is \"killed,\" that character is placed faceup on top of its owner\\'s dead pile.\\r\\nA player cannot marshal, play, put into play, or take control of a copy of any unique ([unique]) card that is in\\r\\nhis or her dead pile.\\r\\nA single instance of a unique card in a player\\'s dead pile does not prevent an efect that would cause the card\\r\\nto enter play directly from the dead pile. This is because such an efect removes the only instance of the card\\r\\nfrom the dead pile.\\r\\nEach player\\'s dead pile is open information, and may be looked at by any player at any time.\\r\\nThe order of the cards in a dead pile may not be altered unless a player is instructed to do so by a card\\r\\nability.\\r\\nIf multiple characters are killed simultaneously, the owner of the cards may physically place them into his or\\r\\nher dead pile one at a time, in any order.\\r\\nRelated: Discard Pile, Leaves Play, Unique Cards\\r\\nDeck, Draw Deck\\r\\nWhen the word \"deck\" appears by itself in rules or in card text, it refers to the deck that contains a player\\'s\\r\\nattachment, character, event, and location cards. This is also known as the \"draw deck.\"\\r\\nAny rule or ability that refers to a plot deck uses the term \"plot deck.\"\\r\\nRelated: Plot Deck\\r\\nDeckbuilding\\r\\nTo build a custom deck for sanctioned tournament play:\\r\\nA player must choose exactly 1 faction card.\\r\\nA player may choose 1 agenda card, or may choose to not use an agenda.\\r\\nA player\\'s plot deck must contain exactly 7 cards. Up to one of the chosen plot cards may be duplicated once\\r\\n(by title) within the plot deck. No more than 1 copy of each of the other plot cards may be in the plot deck.\\r\\nA player\\'s draw deck must contain a minimum of 60 cards.\\r\\nThere is no upper limit on a player\\'s draw deck size.\\r\\nA player\\'s draw deck can only contain up to 3 copies (by title) of any given card.\\r\\nUnless instructed otherwise by a card ability, each card in a player\\'s deck and plot deck must be neutral or its\\r\\nafliation must match the afliation of that player\\'s faction card.\\r\\nRelated: Copy, Deck, Deck Limits, Faction, Plot Deck\\r\\nDeck Limits, Deck Limit: X\\r\\nUp to 3 copies of most cards (by title) may be included in a player\\'s deck. If a card has the text \"Deck Limit: X\" no\\r\\nmore than X copies of that card may be included in a player\\'s deck.\\r\\nIf X is 2 or lower, this phrase acts as a deckbuilding restriction.\\r\\nIf X is 4 or higher, this phrase acts as a permission that enables a player to include more than the standard 3\\r\\ncopies.\\r\\nRelated: Plot Deck Limit: X\\r\\nDefender, Defending Character, Defending Player\\r\\nThe term \"defending character\" refers to a character that is participating in a challenge on the side of the\\r\\ndefending player. The term \"defender\" may also be used as shorthand for \"defending character.\"\\r\\nThe term \"defending player\" refers to the opponent of the attacking player against whom (from the attacking\\r\\nplayer\\'s perspective) the challenge is resolving.\\r\\nRelated: Attacker, Challenges Phase, Participating\\r\\nDelayed Efects\\r\\nSome abilities contain delayed efects. Such abilities specify a future timing point, or indicate a future condition\\r\\nthat may arise, and dictate an efect that is to happen at that time.\\r\\nDelayed efects resolve automatically and immediately after their timing point/future condition occurs,\\r\\nbefore reactions to that moment may be used.\\r\\nWhen a delayed efect resolves, it is not treated as a new triggered ability, even if the delayed efect was\\r\\noriginally created by a triggered ability.\\r\\nRelated: Abilities, Efects, Triggered Abilities\\r\\nDiscard Pile\\r\\nThe discard pile is an out of play area. It is distinct from the dead pile.\\r\\nAny time a card is \"discarded\" (from play or from an out of play area such as a hand or deck), it is placed\\r\\nfaceup on top of its owner\\'s discard pile.\\r\\nEach player\\'s discard pile is open information, and may be looked at by any player at any time.\\r\\nThe order of the cards in a discard pile may not be altered unless a player is instructed to do so by a card\\r\\nability.\\r\\nIf multiple cards are discarded simultaneously, the owner of the cards may physically place them into his or\\r\\nher discard pile one at a time, in any order.\\r\\nRelated: Dead Pile, Leaves Play, Sacrifice\\r\\nDominance Phase\\r\\nSee Appendix I, \"5. Dominance phase\".\\r\\nDrawing Cards\\r\\nWhen a player is instructed to draw one or more cards, those cards are drawn from the top of his or her draw\\r\\ndeck.\\r\\nWhen a player draws 2 or more cards as the result of a single ability or game step, those cards are all drawn\\r\\nsimultaneously.\\r\\nDrawn cards are added to a player\\'s hand.\\r\\nThere is no limit to the number of cards a player may draw each round.\\r\\nRelated: Reserve Value\\r\\nDraw Phase\\r\\nSee Appendix I, \"2. Draw phase\".\\r\\nDuplicates\\r\\nA player may use additional copies, by title, of any unique card (indicated by a \"[unique]\" symbol in its title) he or\\r\\nshe owns and controls in play as duplicates. When a card enters play as a duplicate, it is placed faceup, overlapped\\r\\nby (i.e. partially visible beneath) the copy of the card that was already in play.\\r\\nA duplicate grants its controller the following triggered game ability: \"Interrupt: When the overlapping unique card\\r\\nwould leave play, discard this duplicate to save that card. (Cannot be canceled.)\"\\r\\nThere is no cost to marshal a card as a duplicate.\\r\\nDuplicates are not considered attachments. Duplicates are not afected by and do not interact with text that\\r\\nrefers to attachments.\\r\\nDuplicates have no text, titles, characteristics, type, or traits. A duplicate is only considered a blank \"duplicate\\r\\ncard\" while it is in play.\\r\\nIt is possible to have more than one duplicate on a single card.\\r\\nA diferent version of a unique card may be used as a duplicate on the card. The version of the card that was\\r\\nfirst in play remains as the active version once the duplicate is attached. A player may not switch a card with\\r\\nits duplicate.\\r\\nMarshaling a duplicate is not considered marshaling a card of the duplicate\\'s printed type. It is only\\r\\nconsidered \"marshaling a duplicate card.\"\\r\\nRelated: Ownership and Control, Save, Unique Cards\\r\\nEfects\\r\\nA card efect is any efect that arises from the resolution of ability text printed on, or gained by, a card. A\\r\\nframework efect is any efect that arises from the resolution of a framework event.\\r\\nCard efects might be preceded by costs, triggering conditions, play restrictions, and/or play permissions;\\r\\nsuch elements are not considered efects.\\r\\nOnce initiated, players must resolve as much of each aspect of the efect as they are able, unless the efect\\r\\nuses the word \"may.\"\\r\\nWhen a non-targeting efect attempts to engage a number of entities (such as \"draw 3 cards\" or \"search the\\r\\ntop 10 cards of your deck\") that exceeds the number of entities that currently exist in the specified game\\r\\narea, the efect engages as many entities as possible.\\r\\nThe expiration of a lasting efect (or the cessation of a constant ability) is not considered to be generating a\\r\\ngame state change by a card efect.\\r\\nRelated: Abilities, Costs, Delayed Efects, Lasting Efects, May, Initiating Abilities, Play Restrictions and Permissions,\\r\\nTriggering Condition\\r\\nEnters Play\\r\\nThe phrase \"enters play\" refers to any time a card makes a transition from an out of play area into a play area.\\r\\nMarshaling a card and putting a card into play by using a card ability are two means by which a card may enter\\r\\nplay.\\r\\nRelated: In Play and Out of Play, Marshal, Put into Play\\r\\nEvent Cards\\r\\nEvent cards represent tactical actions, schemes, twists of fate, and other unexpected developments that might\\r\\noccur during the game.\\r\\nAn event card\\'s ability type, triggering condition (if any), and play permissions/restrictions (if any) define\\r\\nwhen and how the card can be played.\\r\\nWhen a player plays an event card, its costs are paid, its efects are resolved (or canceled), and the card is\\r\\nplaced in its owner\\'s discard pile prior to opening the reaction window which follows the ability\\'s resolution.\\r\\nEvent card efects engage the game state at the time they resolve. If an event card creates a lasting efect on\\r\\na set of cards, only cards that are in play at the time the event card is played are eligible to be afected. Cards\\r\\nthat enter play after the resolution of the event are not afected by its lasting efect.\\r\\nIf the efects of an event card are canceled, the card is still considered to have been played, and its costs\\r\\nremain paid. Only the efects have been canceled.\\r\\nUnless the ability that puts it into play also changes its cardtype to a cardtype that is permitted in play, an\\r\\nevent card cannot enter play.\\r\\nRelated: Cancel, Costs, Delayed Efects, Lasting Efects, Play Restrictions and Permissions, Triggering Condition\\r\\nFacedown Cards\\r\\nSome abilities put cards into play facedown. A facedown card has no inherent attributes other than \"facedown\\r\\ncard,\" but it may be granted attributes by the card ability that put it into play.\\r\\nA player may look at the identity of any facedown card that is in play and under his or her control.\\r\\nFaction, Faction Cards\\r\\nThere are 8 factions in the game, shown in the chart below.\\r\\nThe faction card signals which faction a player has chosen as the primary faction for his or her deck. An in-faction\\r\\ncard bears the loyal or non-loyal faction symbol that matches the afliation indicated by his or her faction card.\\r\\nRelated: Deckbuilding, For Your Faction, Loyal\\r\\nFaction Graphic Icon In Text\\r\\nHouse Stark \\ue608 [stark]\\r\\nHouse Lannister \\ue603 [lannister]\\r\\nHouse Baratheon \\ue600 [baratheon]\\r\\nHouse Greyjoy \\ue601 [greyjoy]\\r\\nHouse Tyrell \\ue60a [tyrell]\\r\\nHouse Martell \\ue604 [martell]\\r\\nHouse Targaryen \\ue609 [targaryen]\\r\\nThe Night\\'s Watch \\ue606 [thenightswatch]\\r\\nFirst Player, First Player Token\\r\\nA first player is chosen at random during setup. A new first player is chosen each plot phase by the player who wins\\r\\ninitiative. The chosen player remains the first player until a new first player is chosen. The first player token is used\\r\\nto indicate which player is the first player.\\r\\nThe first player becomes the active player first during the marshaling and challenges phases.\\r\\nDuring all framework event and action/reaction/ interrupt windows the first player has the first opportunity\\r\\nto initiate action, interrupt, or reaction abilities at each appropriate game moment.\\r\\nFor any question as to who should perform an act or make a decision first, in the absence of any other\\r\\ndirection by card or rules text, the first player does so first, and other players follow in player order.\\r\\nIf the first player is eliminated from a game, the player to his or her left becomes the first player.\\r\\nRelated: Active Player, Setup, Initiative, Plot Phase, Priority of Simultaneous Resolution\\r\\nForced Interrupts / Forced Reactions\\r\\nWhile most triggered abilities are optional, some interrupt and reaction abilities are preceded by the word\\r\\n\"Forced.\" Such abilities must be resolved immediately whenever the triggering condition specified in the ability text\\r\\noccurs.\\r\\nFor any given triggering condition, forced interrupts take priority and initiate before non-forced interrupts,\\r\\nand forced reactions take priority and initiate before non-forced reactions.\\r\\nIf two or more forced abilities would initiate at the same moment, the first player determines the order in\\r\\nwhich the abilities initiate, regardless of who controls the cards bearing those abilities.\\r\\nEach forced ability must resolve completely before the next forced ability to the same triggering condition\\r\\nmay initiate.\\r\\nRelated: Interrupts, Reactions\\r\\nFor Your Faction\\r\\nThe phrase \"for your faction\" is used to instruct a player to place the power just gained on his or her faction card.\\r\\nFramework Efects and Framework Events\\r\\nA framework event is a mandatory occurrence dictated by the structure of the game. A framework efect is any\\r\\nefect that arises from the resolution of a framework event.\\r\\nRelated: Appendix I: Timing and Gameplay, Efects\\r\\nGains\\r\\nThe word \"gains\" is used in multiple contexts.\\r\\nIf a player gains gold, the player takes the specified amount of gold from the treasury and adds it to his or\\r\\nher gold pool.\\r\\nIf a player gains power for a card under his or her control, the player takes the specified amount of power\\r\\nfrom the treasury and adds it to the card.\\r\\nIf a card gains a characteristic (such as an icon, a Trait, a keyword, or ability text), the card functions as if it\\r\\npossesses the gained characteristic. Gained characteristics are not considered to be printed on the card.\\r\\nRelated: Gold, Power, Printed\\r\\nGold\\r\\nGold is the game\\'s currency and is used to pay for cards and card abilities. The amount of gold a player has\\r\\navailable at any given time is represented (as open information) by gold tokens in his or her gold pool.\\r\\nGold begins the game in the treasury. When a player gains gold, that player takes an equivalent amount of gold\\r\\nfrom the treasury and adds it to his or her gold pool. When gold is spent it is returned to the treasury from a\\r\\nplayer\\'s gold pool.\\r\\nRelated: Marshaling Phase, Taxation Phase\\r\\nGold Modifier\\r\\nSee \"Plot Value Modifiers\".\\r\\nImmune\\r\\nIf a card is immune to a specified set of efects (for example, \"immune to event card efects,\" or \"immune to [tyrell]\\r\\ncard efects\"), it cannot be targeted or afected by efects that belong to that set. Only the card itself is protected,\\r\\nand peripheral entities associated with an immune card (such as attachments, tokens, abilities originating from an\\r\\nimmune card, or duplicates) are not themselves immune.\\r\\nIf a card gains immunity to an efect, pre-existing lasting efects that have been applied to the card are not\\r\\nremoved.\\r\\nImmunity only protects a card from efects. It does not prevent a card from being used to pay costs.\\r\\nRelated: Costs, Lasting Efects\\r\\nIn Play and Out of Play\\r\\nThe cards (generally characters, locations, attachments, duplicates, and the faction card) that a player controls in\\r\\nthe play area, the title card a player currently bears in a melee game, as well as a player\\'s revealed plot card, are\\r\\nconsidered \"in play.\"\\r\\n\"Out of play\" refers to all other cards and areas involved in the game environment, including: cards in a player\\'s\\r\\nhand, deck, discard pile, dead pile, plot deck, used pile, agendas, and any cards that have been removed from the\\r\\ngame.\\r\\nA card enters play when it transitions from an out of play origin to a play area.\\r\\nA card leaves play when it transitions from a play area to an out of play destination.\\r\\nA player\\'s faction card cannot leave play.\\r\\nOutside of the process by which a player reveals a new plot and his or her previously revealed plot card\\r\\nenters the used pile, a player\\'s plot card cannot leave play.\\r\\nRelated: Abilities, Dead Pile, Deck, Discard Pile, Plot Card\\r\\nIncome\\r\\nWhen a player becomes the active player during the marshaling phase, that player collects income by gaining an\\r\\namount of gold from the treasury equal to the gold value on his or her revealed plot card (which incorporates the\\r\\ntotal value of all relevant gold modifiers).\\r\\nRelated: Gold, Gold Modifier, Marshaling Phase\\r\\nInfluence Tokens\\r\\nInfluence tokens are generic tokens that can be used to track a variety of diferent game states and statuses. They\\r\\nhave no inherent rules.\\r\\nCard abilities can create and define a number of diferent token types, such as \"betrayal tokens,\" \"poison\\r\\ntokens,\" and \"stand tokens.\" When such a token is called for, an influence token is used to track its presence\\r\\nin the game.\\r\\nInitiating Abilities / Marshaling Cards\\r\\nWhen a player wishes to marshal or play a card, or initiate a triggered ability, that player first declares his or her\\r\\nintent (and shows the card to be used, if necessary). The following steps are then observed, in order:\\r\\n1. Check play restrictions: can the card be marshaled or played, or the ability initiated, at this time?\\r\\n2. Determine the cost (or costs, if multiple costs are required) to marshal/play the card or initiate the ability. If it\\r\\nis established that the cost (taking modifiers into account) can be paid, proceed with the remaining steps of\\r\\nthis sequence.\\r\\n3. Apply any modifiers to the cost(s).\\r\\n4. Pay the cost(s).\\r\\n5. Choose target(s), if applicable.\\r\\n6. The card is marshaled/played, or the efects of the ability attempt to initiate. An interrupt ability that cancels\\r\\nthis initiation may be used at this time.\\r\\n7. The efects of the ability (if not canceled in step 6) complete their initiation, and resolve.\\r\\nInterrupts and Reactions may be used throughout this process as normal, should their triggering conditions occur.\\r\\nRelated: Abilities, Cancel, Costs, Play Restrictions and Permissions, Target\\r\\nInitiative\\r\\nA player\\'s initiative is the initiative value on his or her revealed plot card (which incorporates the total value of all\\r\\nrelevant initiative modifiers).\\r\\nWhen new plot cards are revealed for the plot phase, the players compare initiative. The player with the highest\\r\\ninitiative value wins initiative, and chooses which player is the \"first player\" until a new first player is chosen.\\r\\nIf there is a tie at that time for initiative, the tied player with the lowest power total wins initiative. If the lowest\\r\\npower total is also tied, a random method should be used to break this tie.\\r\\nRelated: First Player\\r\\nInitiative Modifier\\r\\nSee \"Plot Value Modifiers\".\\r\\nInsight\\r\\nInsight is a challenge resolution keyword. After a player wins a challenge, for each participating character with the\\r\\ninsight keyword he or she controls, that player may draw 1 card.\\r\\nRelated: Challenges Phase, Keywords\\r\\nInstead\\r\\nSee \"Replacement Efects\".\\r\\nInterrupts\\r\\nAn interrupt is a triggered ability whose text contains the boldface \"Interrupt:\" precursor. An interrupt ability\\r\\ninterrupts the resolution of its triggering condition, sometimes canceling or changing the resolution of that\\r\\ncondition. Always resolve interrupts to a triggering condition before resolving the consequences of the triggering\\r\\ncondition itself.\\r\\nUnlike actions, which may be initiated during action windows, each interrupt may be initiated once each time its\\r\\nspecified triggering condition occurs, as described in the interrupt\\'s ability text.\\r\\nWhen a triggering condition initiates (but before it begins resolving), an interrupt window for that triggering\\r\\ncondition opens.\\r\\nWithin the interrupt window, the first player always has the first opportunity to initiate an eligible interrupt (to this\\r\\ntriggering condition), or pass. Opportunities to initiate an eligible interrupt, or pass, continue in player order until\\r\\nall players consecutively pass, at which point the interrupt window closes. Passing does not prevent a player from\\r\\ninitiating an eligible interrupt later in that same interrupt window.\\r\\nOnce an interrupt window closes, further interrupts to that specific triggering condition cannot be initiated. The\\r\\ntriggering condition now completes its resolution (as long as its efects have not been canceled).\\r\\nIt is possible for multiple interrupts to be initiated from the same triggering condition. Each interrupt must\\r\\nresolve completely before the next interrupt to the same triggering condition may initiate.\\r\\nIf multiple copies of the same interrupt are eligible to be initiated, each copy may be initiated once against\\r\\nthat triggering condition.\\r\\nRelated: Cancel, First Player, Forced Interrupts/Forced Reactions, Nested Ability Sequences, The word \"Would\"\\r\\nIntimidate\\r\\nIntimidate is a challenge resolution keyword. After a player wins a challenge as the attacking player in which he or\\r\\nshe controls a character with the intimidate keyword, that player may choose and kneel a character, controlled by\\r\\nthe losing opponent, with equal or lower STR than the amount of STR by which the challenge was won. (The chosen\\r\\ncharacter is not required to be participating in the challenge.)\\r\\nNo more than one instance of intimidate can successfully resolve during each challenge.\\r\\nRelated: Challenges Phase, Keywords\\r\\nIntrigue Claim\\r\\nWhen a player loses an intrigue ([intrigue]) challenge as the defending player, that player must discard a number of\\r\\nrandom cards from his or her hand equal to the claim value on the attacking player\\'s revealed plot card.\\r\\nIf the player has fewer cards in hand than would satisfy claim, as much of the claim as possible must be satisfied.\\r\\nRelated: Challenges Phase\\r\\nJoust Game\\r\\nA joust game is a head-to-head game between two players.\\r\\nMelee title cards, and their associated framework steps (1.4 and 7.4, see Appendix I), are not used in a joust\\r\\ngame.\\r\\nRelated: Melee Game\\r\\nKeywords\\r\\nA keyword is a card ability which conveys specific rules to its card.\\r\\nSometimes a keyword is followed by reminder text, which is presented in italics. Reminder text is a\\r\\nshorthand explanation of how a keyword works, but it is not rules text and does not replace the rules for\\r\\nthat keyword in this glossary.\\r\\nCards are considered to have a keyword or to not have that keyword. A single card that has and/or is gaining\\r\\nthe same keyword from multiple sources functions as if it has one instance of that keyword. (Note: Instances\\r\\nof Ambush (X) with diferent values for X are considered diferent keywords.)\\r\\nThe keywords in the game are: ambush (X), assault, bestow (X), insight, intimidate, limited, no attachments,\\r\\npillage, prized, renown, shadow (X), stealth, and terminal.\\r\\nRelated: Ambush, Assault, Bestow, Insight, Intimidate, Limited, No Attachments, Pillage, Prized, Renown, Shadows,\\r\\nStealth, Terminal\\r\\nKill, Killed\\r\\nCharacters can be killed by framework efects and by card abilities. When a character is killed, it leaves play and is\\r\\nplaced faceup on top of its owner\\'s dead pile.\\r\\nRelated: Dead Pile, Leaves Play, Save\\r\\nKneel, Kneeling, Knelt\\r\\nCards often kneel in order to attack, defend, or use certain card abilities. When a card is knelt, it is rotated 90\\r\\ndegrees. A card in this latter state is considered kneeling.\\r\\nA kneeling card cannot kneel again until it is standing (typically by a game step or card ability).\\r\\nRelated: Stand, Standing\\r\\nCard Search Syntax\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './agot_rag/Rules · ThronesDB.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='Lasting Efects\\r\\nSome card abilities create efects or conditions that afect the game state for a specified duration (such as \"until\\r\\nthe end of the challenge\" or \"until the end of the phase\"). Such efects are known as lasting efects.\\r\\nA lasting efect persists beyond the resolution of the ability that created it, for the duration specified by the\\r\\nefect. The efect continues to afect the game state for the specified duration regardless of whether the card\\r\\nthat created the lasting efect is or remains in play.\\r\\nA lasting efect expires as soon as the timing point specified by its duration is reached. This means that an\\r\\n\"until the end of the round\" lasting efect expires just before an \"at the end of the round\" ability may initiate.\\r\\nAny \"until the end of the X\" efects that would initiate after the end of X (via the resolution of an interrupt or\\r\\nreaction ability to something that occurred at the end of X) would expire immediately without afecting the\\r\\ngame state, and therefore fail to initiate.\\r\\nLeaves Play\\r\\nThe phrase \"leaves play\" refers to any time a card makes a transition from an in play state to an out of play state.\\r\\nIf a card leaves play, the following consequences occur simultaneously with the card leaving play:\\r\\nAll tokens on the card are returned to the treasury.\\r\\nAll duplicates on the card are discarded.\\r\\nAll attachments that are on the card are returned to their owners\\' hands.\\r\\nAll lasting efects and/or delayed efects afecting the card while it is in play expire for that card.\\r\\nRelated: In Play and Out of Play\\r\\nLimited\\r\\nLimited is a keyword ability. No more than 1 card in total with the limited keyword can be marshaled (or played, if\\r\\nthe card is an event) by each player each round. No more than 1 limited card can be placed by each player during\\r\\nsetup.\\r\\nLimited cards that are \"put into play\" via card efects ignore and are ignored by this restriction.\\r\\nRelated: Keywords, Put into Play\\r\\nLimits and Maxima\\r\\n\"Limit X per [period]\" is a limit that appears on cards that remain in play through the resolution of an ability\\'s\\r\\nefect. Each copy of an ability with such a limit may be used X times during the designated period. If a card leaves\\r\\nplay and re-enters play during the same period, the card is considered to be bringing a new copy of the ability to\\r\\nthe game.\\r\\n\"Limit X copies per [card/game element]\" is a limit that appears on attachment cards, and restricts the number of\\r\\ncopies of that card (by title) that can be attached to each designated card or game element.\\r\\n\"Max X per [period]\" is a maximum that appears on cards that do not enter or remain in play through the\\r\\nresolution of their efect. (An event card, for example.) Such a phrase imposes a maximum number of times that\\r\\nability can be initiated from all copies (by title) of cards bearing the ability (including itself), during the designated\\r\\nperiod. Initiating an ability on a card counts towards the maximum for all copies of that card.\\r\\nAll limits and maxima are player specific.\\r\\nIf the efects of a card or ability with a limit or a maximum are canceled, it is still counted against the\\r\\nlimit/maximum.\\r\\nRelated: Deck Limits, Plot Deck Limits\\r\\nLocation Cards\\r\\nLocation cards represent the castles, cities, forests, shops, taverns, brothels, streets, and other places one might\\r\\ndiscover in the A Song of Ice and Fire setting. These cards enter play in the back row of a player\\'s play area and\\r\\nremain in play unless removed by an ability.\\r\\nLook\\r\\nWhen a player is instructed to \"look\" at one or more cards, that player does not show the cards to his or her\\r\\nopponents. A card is not considered to leave its play area while it is being looked at. A look instruction ends when a\\r\\ncard is returned to its prior state of concealment, or reaches a new destination.\\r\\nLoyal, Loyalty\\r\\nLoyalty is a deckbuilding restriction that limits which cards can be used out-of-faction. A card is loyal to its faction if\\r\\nit has a scroll of parchment below its shield. A loyal card\\'s afliation must match the afliation of a deck\\'s faction\\r\\ncard in order to be included in the deck. Certain card abilities (such as the Banner agenda cards) permit players to\\r\\nuse non-loyal cards out-of-faction in a deck.\\r\\nRelated: Deckbuilding\\r\\nMarshal\\r\\nIn the Marshaling phase, the active player can (as a player action) marshal a character, location, or attachment card\\r\\n(or a duplicate) from his or her hand by paying that card\\'s gold cost and placing the card in his or her play area. A\\r\\nplayer pays a gold cost by returning the indicated amount of gold from his or her gold pool to the treasury.\\r\\nWhen a card is marshaled, it is considered to have entered play.\\r\\nEvent cards are not marshaled, they are played.\\r\\nCard abilities that put a card directly into play are not considered to be marshaling the card.\\r\\nRelated: Costs, Duplicates, Enters Play, Event Cards, Initiating Abilities/Marshaling Cards, Put into Play\\r\\nMarshaling Phase\\r\\nSee Appendix I, \"3.

The chosen characters are all killed simultaneously.\\r\\nIf the player controls fewer characters than would satisfy claim, as much of the claim as possible must be satisfied.\\r\\nThe same character cannot be chosen more than once to satisfy claim for a single [military] challenge.\\r\\nIf a character chosen to be killed for military claim is saved, the choice still serves to satisfy the claim.\\r\\nRelated: Challenges Phase, Save\\r\\nModifiers\\r\\nSome abilities may ask players to modify values. The game state constantly checks and (if necessary) updates the\\r\\ncount of any variable quantity that is being modified.\\r\\nAny time a new modifier is applied (or removed), the entire quantity is recalculated from the start, considering the\\r\\nunmodified base value and all active modifiers.\\r\\nThe calculation of a value should treat all modifiers as being applied simultaneously. However, while\\r\\nperforming the calculation, all additive and subtractive modifiers should be calculated before doubling\\r\\nand/or halving modifiers are calculated.\\r\\nFractional values are rounded up after all modifiers have been applied.\\r\\nWhen a value is \"set\" to a specific number, the set modifier overrides all non-set modifiers (including any\\r\\nnew non-set modifiers that are added during the duration of the set value). If multiple set modifiers are in\\r\\nconflict, the most recently applied set modifier takes precedence.\\r\\nA quantity cannot be reduced so that it functions with a value below zero: a card cannot have \"negative\"\\r\\nicons, STR, traits, cost, or keywords. Negative modifiers in excess of a value\\'s current quantity can be applied,\\r\\nbut, after all active modifiers have been applied, any resultant value below zero is treated as zero.\\r\\nRelated: Base Value\\r\\nMove\\r\\nSome efects allow players to move cards or tokens.\\r\\nWhen an entity moves, it cannot move to its same (current) placement. If there is no valid destination for a\\r\\nmove, the move attempt cannot be made.\\r\\nMoving Power\\r\\nSome efects (such as a power challenge claim) allow players to move power from one card to another. Power that\\r\\nis moved is not considered \"gained.\"\\r\\nPower that is moved to a card under a diferent player\\'s control counts toward that player\\'s victory condition.\\r\\nRelated: Gains, Power Claim\\r\\nMulligan\\r\\nAfter a player draws a starting hand during setup (but before placing any cards in setup), that player has a one\\x02time option to declare a mulligan draw. After doing so, the player reshufes his or her starting hand into his or her\\r\\ndeck and draws a new starting hand of 7 cards. The player must keep this second hand.\\r\\nPlayers decide in player order whether or not to take a mulligan.\\r\\nRelated: Setup\\r\\nNegative Quantities\\r\\nSee \"Modifiers\".\\r\\nNested Ability Sequences\\r\\nEach time a triggering condition occurs, the following sequence is followed: (1) execute any interrupts to that\\r\\ntriggering condition, (2) resolve the triggering condition, and then (3) execute any reactions to that triggering\\r\\ncondition.\\r\\nWithin this sequence, if an interrupt or a reaction to the original triggering condition generates a new triggering\\r\\ncondition, the game pauses and starts a new sequence: (1) execute interrupts to the new triggering condition, (2)\\r\\nresolve the new triggering condition, and then (3) execute reactions to the new triggering condition. Once this\\r\\nnested sequence is fully completed, the game returns to where it left of, continuing with the original triggering\\r\\ncondition\\'s sequence.\\r\\nIt is possible that a nested sequence generates further triggering conditions (and hence more nested sequences).\\r\\nThere is no limit to the number of nested sequences that may occur, but each nested sequence must complete\\r\\nbefore returning to the sequence that spawned it. In efect, these sequences are resolved in a Last In, First Out\\r\\n(LIFO) manner.\\r\\nIn each interrupt window and each reaction window, nested or not, the first player always has the first opportunity\\r\\nto initiate an interrupt or reaction (respectively).\\r\\nRelated: Interrupts, Reactions\\r\\nNeutral\\r\\nSome cards are not afliated with any faction; these cards are neutral. Any deck may include neutral cards.\\r\\nNeutral cards are not considered to be in-faction or out-of-faction.\\r\\nRelated: Deckbuilding, Faction\\r\\nNext Player\\r\\nSee \"Player Order\".\\r\\nNo Attachments\\r\\nNo attachments is a keyword ability. A card with this keyword cannot have an attachment card attached.\\r\\nIf one or more traits precedes the word \"attachments,\" the card cannot have an attachment that possesses\\r\\none of the specified traits, but it can have attachments possessing none of those traits.\\r\\nIf the word \"attachments\" is followed by the word \"except\" and one or more traits, the card can have\\r\\nattachments that possess one or more of the specified traits, but it cannot have attachments possessing\\r\\nnone of those traits.\\r\\nIf a card has multiple variants of the \"no attachments\" keyword, any variant that would prevent a card from\\r\\nhaving a given attachment prevails.\\r\\nRelated: Attachment Cards, Keywords, Traits\\r\\nOut of Play\\r\\nSee \"In Play and Out of Play\".\\r\\nOwnership and Control\\r\\nA card\\'s owner is the player whose deck held the card at the start of the game.\\r\\nCards by default enter play under their owner\\'s control. Some abilities may cause cards to change control\\r\\nduring a game.\\r\\nA player controls the cards located in his or her out of play game areas (such as the hand, deck, discard pile,\\r\\nand dead pile).\\r\\nIf a card would enter an out of play area of a player who does not own the card, the card is placed in its\\r\\nowner\\'s equivalent out of play area instead. (For all associated card ability and framework efect purposes,\\r\\nthe card is considered to have entered that opponent\\'s out of play area, and only the physical placement of\\r\\nthe card is adjusted.)\\r\\nIf a participating character changes control during the resolution of a challenge, it is immediately removed\\r\\nfrom the challenge.\\r\\nRelated: Deck, Leaves Play\\r\\nParticipating\\r\\nAny character that has been declared as an attacker or as a defender for a challenge is considered participating in\\r\\nthat challenge through the resolution of the challenge.\\r\\nA character is either participating or not participating in a challenge.\\r\\nIf an ability explicitly removes a character from a challenge, that character is no longer participating in the\\r\\nchallenge.\\r\\nIf a participating character leaves play for any reason, it is no longer participating in the challenge.\\r\\nOnce a character is participating in a challenge, losing the challenge icon of that type does not remove the\\r\\ncharacter from the challenge.\\r\\nRelated: Attacker, Challenges Phase, Defender\\r\\nPass\\r\\nThere are numerous points in the game where a player has an option between performing an act (such as taking\\r\\nan action, triggering an ability, or executing a game step) or passing. Passing in such a situation forfeits the player\\'s\\r\\nright to perform that act at that moment.\\r\\nMany game sequences continue until all players pass consecutively. Should one player perform the function\\r\\n(i.e., not pass) during his or her opportunity, opportunities to perform or pass continue clockwise in player\\r\\norder until a state of consecutive passes by all players is achieved. Passing an opportunity does not prevent a\\r\\nplayer from acting during his or her next opportunity in the same sequence, as long as a state of consecutive\\r\\npasses by all players does not occur.\\r\\nPillage\\r\\nPillage is a challenge resolution keyword. After a player wins a challenge, for each participating character with the\\r\\npillage keyword he or she controls, that player may discard 1 card from the top of the losing opponent\\'s deck.\\r\\nRelated: Challenges Phase, Keywords\\r\\nPlay Restrictions and Permissions\\r\\nMany cards or abilities contain specific instructions pertaining to when or how they may or may not be used, or to\\r\\nspecific conditions that must be true in order to use them. In order to use such an ability or play/marshal such a\\r\\ncard, these play restrictions must be observed. A permission is an optional play restriction, which allows a player to\\r\\nplay/marshal a card or use an ability outside the timing or specifications provided by the game rules.\\r\\nRelated: Event Cards, Initiating Abilities / Marshaling Cards\\r\\nPlayer Order\\r\\nIf the players are instructed to perform a sequence in \"player order,\" the first player performs his or her part of the\\r\\nsequence first, followed by the other players in clockwise order. The phrase \"the next player\" is used in this context\\r\\nto refer to the next player (clockwise) to act in player order.\\r\\nRelated: First Player\\r\\nPlot Card\\r\\nPlot cards represent the round-by-round strategic decisions and plans a player makes throughout the course of a\\r\\ngame. A player\\'s plot deck begins the game with exactly seven plot cards. Each plot card possesses a gold, initiative,\\r\\nclaim, and reserve value. Many plot cards also possess an ability.\\r\\nEach plot card exists in one of three states: in the plot deck, revealed, or in the used pile.\\r\\nWhen a player reveals a new plot card, it leaves the plot deck and enters the revealed state. Place it on top of\\r\\nthat player\\'s previously revealed plot card. This removes the previously revealed plot card from play, and\\r\\nreplaces it with the newly revealed plot card. All plot cards under a player\\'s currently revealed plot card are\\r\\nconsidered that player\\'s used pile.\\r\\nA player\\'s revealed plot card is considered in play and interacts with the game state.\\r\\nWhen a player reveals the final card of his or her plot deck, after all just revealed plot cards have entered\\r\\nplay and all necessary \"When Revealed\" abilities have resolved, each plot card in that player\\'s used pile is\\r\\nreturned to his or her plot deck. The just revealed plot card is not yet in the used pile, and remains revealed.\\r\\nRelated: In Play and Out of Play, Plot Deck, When Revealed\\r\\nPlot Deck\\r\\nEach player uses his or her own plot deck. A player\\'s plot deck begins the game with exactly seven cards. One of\\r\\nthose plot cards may have an additional copy (by title) within the plot deck. No more than one copy of each of the\\r\\nother plot cards may be included in the plot deck.\\r\\nRelated: Deckbuilding, Plot Card, Plot Deck Limit: X\\r\\nPlot Deck Limit: X\\r\\nIf a plot card bears the phrase, \"Plot Deck Limit: X,\" no more than X copies (by title) of the plot card may be\\r\\nincluded in a plot deck.\\r\\nIf X is 1, this phrase acts as a deckbuilding restriction. A player cannot include an additional copy of this plot\\r\\ncard in his or her plot deck.\\r\\nIf X is 3 or higher, this phrase acts as a deckbuilding permission. A player may include up to X copies of this\\r\\nplot card in his or her plot deck, should this plot card be selected by the player as the one card for which\\r\\nadditional copies are permitted.\\r\\nPlot Phase\\r\\nSee Appendix I, \"1. Plot phase\".\\r\\nPlot Value Modifiers\\r\\nThe following icons modify the values of various statistics on their controller\\'s revealed plot card. Such\\r\\nmodifications are mandatory.\\r\\n+1 Income +1 Reserve +1 Initiative\\r\\nGold Modifier Reserve Modifier Initiative Modifier\\r\\nAll active plot value modifiers under a player\\'s control are cumulative in their efect upon that player\\'s\\r\\nrevealed plot card.\\r\\nIf a card\\'s printed text box is considered blank, any modifiers printed in that text box are not active.\\r\\nPower\\r\\nThe object of the game is for a player to have 15 (or more) power. A player\\'s power total is equal to the amount of\\r\\npower amassed on cards under his or her control, and is tracked using power counters.\\r\\nRelated: Winning the Game\\r\\nPower Claim\\r\\nWhen a player loses a power ([power]) challenge as the defending player, that player must remove a number of\\r\\npower from his or her faction card equal to the claim value on the attacking player\\'s revealed plot card, and move\\r\\nit to the attacking player\\'s faction card.\\r\\nIf the player controls less power than would satisfy claim, as much of the claim as possible must be satisfied.\\r\\nRelated: Challenges Phase\\r\\nPrinted\\r\\nThe word \"printed\" refers to the text, characteristic, icon, or value that is physically printed on the card.\\r\\nRelated: Blank\\r\\nPriority of Simultaneous Resolution\\r\\nIf a single efect afects multiple players simultaneously, but the players must individually make choices to resolve\\r\\nthe efect, the first player chooses first, followed by the other players in player order. Once all necessary choices\\r\\nhave been made, the efect resolves simultaneously upon all afected entities.\\r\\nIf the resolution of two or more when revealed abilities, delayed efects, or forced abilities would resolve at\\r\\nthe same time, the first player decides the order in which the abilities resolve, regardless of who controls the\\r\\ncards bearing the conflicting abilities.\\r\\nIf two or more constant abilities and/or lasting efects cannot be applied simultaneously, the first player\\r\\ndetermines the order in which the constant abilities are applied.\\r\\nRelated: First Player\\r\\nPrized\\r\\nPrized is a keyword ability. When a character, location, or attachment with the prized (X) keyword would leave play,\\r\\neach opponent of that card\\'s controller gains X power for his or her faction. This occurs immediately upon the card\\r\\nleaving play, after resolving any interrupts to the card leaving play, but prior to triggering any reactions to the card\\r\\nleaving play.\\r\\nWhen an event with the prized (X) keyword is played, each opponent of the player who plays the event gains X\\r\\npower for his or her faction. This occurs immediately upon the event being played, prior to initiating its efects.\\r\\nWhen a plot with the prized (X) keyword is placed in the used pile, each opponent of that plot\\'s controller gains X\\r\\npower for his or her faction.\\r\\nIf a card has multiple instances of the prized (X) keyword, those instances are cumulative.\\r\\nRelated: Keywords\\r\\nPut into Play\\r\\nSome card abilities may cause a card to be \"put into play.\" Such abilities place the card directly into play from an\\r\\nout of play state.\\r\\nThe gold cost of the card being \"put into play\" is not paid.\\r\\nUnless otherwise instructed by the \"put into play\" efect, cards that enter play in this manner must do so in a\\r\\nplay area or attachment state that satisfies the rules of marshaling the card.\\r\\nA card that has been put into play is not considered to have been \"marshaled.\"\\r\\nIf an additional copy of a unique card a player already owns and controls is put into play under his or her\\r\\ncontrol, it enters play as a duplicate.\\r\\nRelated: Dead Pile, Duplicates, In Play and Out of Play, Marshal, Unique Cards\\r\\nQualifiers\\r\\nIf card text includes a qualifier followed by multiple terms, the qualifier applies to each item in the list, if it is\\r\\napplicable. For example, in the phrase \"each unique character and location,\" the word \"unique\" applies both to\\r\\n\"character\" and to \"location.\"\\r\\nReactions\\r\\nA reaction is a triggered ability whose text contains the boldface \"Reaction:\" precursor. Always resolve a triggering\\r\\ncondition before initiating any reactions to that triggering condition.\\r\\nUnlike actions, which are resolved during action windows, each reaction may be initiated once each time its\\r\\nspecified triggering condition occurs, as described in the reaction\\'s ability text.\\r\\nAfter a triggering condition resolves, a reaction window for that triggering condition opens.\\r\\nWithin the reaction window, the first player always has the first opportunity to initiate an eligible reaction (to this\\r\\ntriggering condition), or pass. Opportunities to initiate an eligible reaction, or pass, continue in player order until all\\r\\nplayers consecutively pass, at which point the reaction window closes. Passing does not prevent a player from\\r\\ninitiating an eligible reaction later in that same reaction window.\\r\\nOnce a reaction window closes, further reactions to that specific triggering condition cannot be initiated.\\r\\nIt is possible for multiple reactions to be initiated from the same triggering condition. Each reaction must\\r\\nresolve completely before the next reaction to the same triggering condition may initiate.\\r\\nIf multiple copies of the same reaction are eligible to be initiated, each copy may be initiated once against\\r\\nthat triggering condition. Each eligible reaction may be used once per trigger. (If multiple copies of the same\\r\\nreaction are eligible, each copy may be used once.)\\r\\nRelated: Interrupts, Nested Ability Sequences\\r\\nRedirect (Melee game only)\\r\\nThe Crown Regent title card can be used to redirect a single challenge each round. This ability is used after a\\r\\nchallenge is initiated, before any reactions to that challenge\\'s initiation can be triggered.\\r\\nIf a challenge is redirected, the player who is initiating the challenge must immediately choose a new opponent to\\r\\nresolve the challenge against. The attacking player may also choose new stealth targets (controlled by the new\\r\\ndefending player) if he or she desires. Any originally declared stealth targets are not considered to have been\\r\\nbypassed by stealth; any new targets are.\\r\\nThe challenge is still considered to have been initiated against the original opponent, but it resolves against the\\r\\nnew opponent.\\r\\nA redirected challenge may not be resolved against the same opponent it was originally initiated against.\\r\\nAny efect that would prevent a challenge from being initiated against a player does not prevent a redirected\\r\\nchallenge from resolving against that player. (This means that a redirected challenge may resolve against an\\r\\nopponent the attacking player supports.)\\r\\nThe player initiating the challenge cannot change which characters he or she has declared, or the challenge type\\r\\nthat has been announced, when a challenge has been redirected.\\r\\nRelated: Melee Game\\r\\nRemoved from Game\\r\\nA card that has been removed from the game is set aside and has no further interaction with the game in any\\r\\nmanner for the duration of its removal.\\r\\nIf there is no specified duration, a card that has been removed from the game is considered removed until the end\\r\\nof the game.\\r\\nRelated: In Play and Out of Play\\r\\nRenown\\r\\nRenown is a challenge resolution keyword. After a player wins a challenge, each participating character with the\\r\\nrenown keyword he or she controls may gain 1 power.\\r\\nRelated: Challenges Phase, Keywords\\r\\nReplacement Efects\\r\\nA replacement efect is an efect (usually an interrupt) that replaces the resolution of a triggering condition with a\\r\\ndiferent means of resolving that same triggering condition, but in such a manner that the triggering condition is\\r\\nstill considered to occur. The word \"instead\" is frequently indicative of a such an efect. After all interrupts to the\\r\\ntriggering condition have resolved and it is time to resolve the triggering condition itself, the replacement efect\\r\\nresolves instead.\\r\\nIf multiple replacement efects are initiated against the same triggering condition, the most recent replacement\\r\\nefect is the one that is used for the resolution of the triggering condition.\\r\\nFor example, Benjen Stark has the following replacement efect, \"Interrupt: When Benjen Stark is killed, gain 2 power for\\r\\nyour faction. Then, shufe him back into your deck instead of placing him in your dead pile.\" The triggering condition (i.e.\\r\\nthe killing of Benjen Stark) will still occur, but the triggering condition will resolve diferently from normal because the\\r\\ncard will be shufed back into its owner\\'s deck rather than being placed in its owner\\'s dead pile.\\r\\nRelated: Interrupts\\r\\nReserve Value\\r\\nEach plot card has a reserve value. During the taxation phase, each player compares his or her current hand size\\r\\n(i.e., the number of cards in the player\\'s hand) with the reserve value on his or her currently revealed plot (which\\r\\nincorporates all relevant reserve modifiers). If a player\\'s hand size is higher than his or her reserve value, that\\r\\nplayer must choose and discard cards from his or her hand until the hand size is equal to the reserve value. All\\r\\nplayers perform this process in player order.\\r\\nRelated: Plot Value Modifiers\\r\\nReserve Modifier\\r\\nSee \"Plot Value Modifiers\".\\r\\nReveal\\r\\nWhen a player is instructed to reveal cards, that player is obliged to show those cards to his or her opponents. If\\r\\nthere is no specified duration for the reveal, the revealed cards remain revealed until they reach a new destination\\r\\n(as specified by the ability), or through the completion of the ability\\'s resolution.\\r\\nWhile it is revealed, a revealed card is still considered to be located in the game area (such as a player\\'s hand\\r\\nor deck) from which it is revealed.\\r\\nRevealed Plot\\r\\nSee \"Plot Card\".\\r\\nRivals (Melee game only)\\r\\nIf a player\\'s title card lists another title as a \"rival,\" that player gains 1 power for his or her faction after winning a\\r\\nchallenge against an opponent who bears that rival title. This occurs during framework step 4.2.3 (see Appendix I)\\r\\nand is known as a rivals bonus.\\r\\nA player can gain a maximum of 1 rivals bonus per rival opponent by winning a challenge against that\\r\\nopponent each round.\\r\\nRelated: Melee Game, Title Cards\\r\\nSacrifice\\r\\nWhen a player is instructed to sacrifice a card, that player must choose a card in play that he or she controls and\\r\\nthat matches the requirements of the sacrifice, and place it in his or her discard pile.\\r\\nIf the chosen card does not leave play, the sacrifice is not considered to have been made.\\r\\nSacrificing a card does not satisfy any other means (such as \"kill\" or \"discard\") of a card leaving play.\\r\\nA sacrificed card cannot be saved.\\r\\nRelated: Ownership and Control, Save\\r\\nSave\\r\\nWhen a card is saved from an efect that attempts to remove that card from play, the card remains in play as the\\r\\nefect resolves and is not considered to have been killed, discarded, or otherwise removed from play by the efect.\\r\\nIf a card is saved from [military] claim, the card was still chosen for [military] claim, and therefore is still\\r\\ncounted towards the fulfillment of the claim.\\r\\nIf an aspect of an ability that removes a card from play is followed by the text \"cannot be saved,\" players\\r\\ncannot attempt to save that card.\\r\\nIf a constant ability or lasting efect imposes a condition upon a card that would continually drive it from play\\r\\n(for example, a lasting efect that applies to a character over a period of time, and kills that character if its STR is\\r\\n0), any attempt to save the card must also remedy the ongoing condition. Otherwise, upon resolution of the\\r\\nsave attempt, the card is immediately re-exposed to the ongoing condition, and removed from play.\\r\\nTherefore, if the save efect does not also remedy the ongoing condition, it cannot be initiated, as the efect\\r\\nhas no potential to change the game state. As such, using a duplicate to save from such an ongoing condition\\r\\nis also prohibited.\\r\\nRelated: Efects, Military Claim, The word \"Would\"\\r\\nSearch\\r\\nWhen a player is instructed to search for a card, that player is permitted to look at all of the cards in the searched\\r\\narea without revealing those cards to his or her opponents.\\r\\nIf an efect searches an entire deck, the deck must be shufed to the satisfaction of each opponent upon\\r\\ncompletion of the search.\\r\\nA player is not obliged to find the object of a search efect, even if the searched cards contain a card that\\r\\nmeets the eligibility requirements of the search.\\r\\nIf a search efect would add a card with specified characteristics to a hidden game area, the player fulfilling\\r\\nthe search must reveal the card to his or her opponent to verify that the card is eligible to be found by the\\r\\nsearch.\\r\\nWhile cards are being searched, they are not considered to have left their play area of origin.\\r\\nRelated: Deck\\r\\nSelf-Referential Text\\r\\nWhen a card\\'s ability text refers to its own title, it is referring to itself only, and not to other copies (by title) of the\\r\\ncard.\\r\\nRelated: Copy\\r\\nSet\\r\\nSee \"Modifiers\".\\r\\nSetup\\r\\nTo setup a game, perform the following steps in order:\\r\\n1. Determine game format and select decks. Games with two players use the joust format. Games with three\\r\\nor more players use the melee format.\\r\\n2. Determine first player. Randomly determine a player to be denoted as first player while setting up the game.\\r\\nPlace the first player token in front of this player.\\r\\n3. Announce factions and agendas (if any). In player order, each player announces the faction and agenda (if\\r\\nany) that his or her deck uses, and places the faction card and agenda (if any) faceup in his or her play area.\\r\\n4. Create treasury. Place the gold tokens, power counters, and influence tokens in a pile within reach of each\\r\\nplayer. This area is known as the treasury.\\r\\n5. Place plot decks. Each player places his or her plot deck facedown next to his or her faction card.\\r\\n6. Shufe draw decks. Each player shufes his or her draw deck to the satisfaction of all opponents.\\r\\n7. Draw setup hands. Each player draws seven cards from his or her draw deck. Each player, in player order,\\r\\nhas the option to take a single mulligan by shufing those seven cards back into his or her deck and drawing\\r\\nseven new cards.\\r\\n8. Place setup cards. Each player, in player order, may place up to a total of 8 cost worth of character, location,\\r\\nand attachment cards from his or her hand as setup cards. Setup cards are placed facedown in a player\\'s play\\r\\narea. When placing setup cards, the following restrictions must be observed:\\r\\nNo more than 8 total cost worth of cards may be placed.\\r\\nNo more than 1 card with the \"Limited\" keyword may be placed.\\r\\nOnly character, location, and attachment cards may be placed.\\r\\nEach attachment that is placed must be attached to an eligible target under its owner’s control when the\\r\\nattachment is revealed in the next step.\\r\\nAdditional copies of unique cards may be placed in setup at no cost, and revealed as duplicates in the\\r\\nfollowing step.\\r\\n9. Reveal setup cards. All players turn their setup cards faceup simultaneously. Then, each player attaches his\\r\\nor her attachments and places his or her duplicates, in player order. Note: Cards are not considered to have\\r\\nbeen marshaled, played, put into play, or to have entered play when they are revealed or announced in setup,\\r\\nand card abilities that reference those terms are ignored during this step. These cards are considered \"already\\r\\nin play\" when the game begins.\\r\\n10. Replenish opening hand. Each player draws cards until there are seven cards in his or her hand.\\r\\nRelated: Duplicates, Mulligan\\r\\nShadows\\r\\nShadows is a new feature of A Game of Thrones: The Card Game, introducing a new keyword ability and a new game\\r\\narea.\\r\\nThe Shadow Keyword\\r\\nShadow is a keyword ability. A card with shadow (X) can be marshaled facedown into its controller\\'s shadows area\\r\\nfor 2 gold. That card can later be played (if it is an event) or brought into play faceup (if it is a character, location, or\\r\\nattachment) by paying X gold.\\r\\nIn addition to the presence of the shadow keyword in the text box, cards with the shadow keyword can be easily\\r\\nidentified by the presence of a banner around the card\\'s gold cost.\\r\\nMarshaling a card into shadows\\r\\nDuring the marshaling phase, the active player may, as a player action, pay 2 gold to marshal a card with the\\r\\nshadow keyword into shadows from his or her hand. A card marshaled into shadows is placed facedown in an area\\r\\nclearly separate from other game areas. There is no limit to the number of cards that a player can marshal into\\r\\nshadows during the marshaling phase.\\r\\nMarshaling a card into shadows is not considered to be \"playing\" a card. Marshaling a card into shadows is not\\r\\nconsidered to be marshaling a card with any of that card\\'s characteristics; it is only considered to be \"marshaling a\\r\\ncard into shadows.\"\\r\\nCards without the shadow keyword cannot be marshaled into shadows. However, such cards may be placed into\\r\\nshadows by card efects. If a card is placed into shadows by a card efect, that card is placed facedown in its\\r\\ncontroller\\'s shadows area. An efect that causes a card to \"return\" to shadows will place that card into shadows,\\r\\neven if that card did not enter play from shadows.\\r\\nDuring setup, cards with the shadow keyword (including events) may be placed into shadows by spending 2 gold\\r\\nfrom the amount allocated for setup for each card. When setup cards are revealed, any cards that were placed into\\r\\nshadows remain facedown in their controller\\'s shadows area.\\r\\nWhile a card is in shadows\\r\\nShadows is a distinct out-of-play area; cards in shadows are not considered to be \"in play\" nor \"in hand.\"\\r\\nEach card in shadows is facedown, and remains facedown while it is in shadows. A player may look at any card he\\r\\nor she controls in shadows, at any time. A player may not look at any opponent\\'s card in shadows.\\r\\nIf a player has multiple cards in shadows, that player must ensure that those cards can be easily diferentiated\\r\\nfrom one another. A player cannot shufe or rearrange his or her cards in shadows in a way that disguises the\\r\\nidentity of those cards.\\r\\nEach player\\'s shadows area should be visually separate from their other game areas, and from each other player\\'s.\\r\\nSome efects may place one or more tokens on a card in shadows. If a card transitions from shadows to any other\\r\\ngame area, all tokens on that card are discarded.\\r\\nBringing a card out of shadows\\r\\nA card\\'s \"shadow cost\" is the value listed in parentheses after the shadow keyword. For instance, a card with the\\r\\ntext \"Shadow (4)\" has a shadow cost of 4. Any efect that modifies the cost to bring a card out of shadows modifies\\r\\nthat card\\'s shadow cost.\\r\\nAs an action, a player may bring a character, location, or attachment out of shadows and into play by paying its\\r\\nshadow cost (e.g. paying 4 gold to bring a \"Shadow (4)\" card into play). A card that is brought out of shadows and\\r\\ninto play is considered to be entering play using a card ability; it is not considered to have been \"marshaled\" or\\r\\n\"played.\"\\r\\nAn attachment that is brought out of shadows must immediately be attached to an eligible card. If there are no\\r\\neligible cards to attach to, the attachment is discarded without entering play.\\r\\nAn event in shadows may be played by paying its shadow cost whenever its triggering condition and/or play\\r\\nconditions are met, as if a player were playing it from his or her hand.\\r\\nIf a card has multiple instances of the shadow keyword, each with a diferent (X) value, the player controlling the\\r\\ncard may choose which instance of the shadow keyword is used to bring the card out of shadows.\\r\\nSome efects allow a card to be \"put into play\" from shadows. Such abilities place the card directly into play from its\\r\\ncontroller\\'s shadows area. The shadow cost of a card being \"put into play\" is not paid. An event card cannot be put\\r\\ninto play by such an efect.\\r\\nA character, location, or attachment is considered to \"come out of shadows\" if it enters play from shadows. An\\r\\nevent is considered to \"come out of shadows\" if it is played from shadows.\\r\\nPrinted cost of shadows cards\\r\\nMany cards with the shadow keyword also have a standard printed cost, in the upper left corner of the card. Any\\r\\nreference to a card\\'s \"printed cost\" refers to this value. Such a card may be marshaled or played from a player\\'s\\r\\nhand by paying its printed cost, following standard game rules.\\r\\nDuring setup, such a card may either be placed as normal for its printed cost, or placed into shadows for 2 gold.\\r\\nWhile such a card is in shadows, it may be brought out of shadows only by paying its shadow cost.\\r\\nSome cards with the shadow keyword have a \"-\" in place of their printed cost. Such a card cannot be marshaled or\\r\\nplayed from a player\\'s hand, and may only be played by being brought out of shadows. Such a card has no printed\\r\\ncost. If an ability references the printed cost of that card, a null value is returned.\\r\\nUnique cards and shadows\\r\\nA unique card may be marshaled into shadows even if its owner already has a copy of that card in play or in his or\\r\\nher dead pile.\\r\\nA player may bring a unique card out of shadows by paying its shadow cost even if he or she owns and controls\\r\\nanother copy of that unique card in play. However, the card will enter play as a duplicate.\\r\\nBringing a unique card out of shadows is subject to the same restrictions as any other attempt to put a unique card\\r\\ninto play. If a unique card is unable to enter play legally, it may not be brought out of shadows.\\r\\nStand, Standing\\r\\nA card that is in an upright state so that its controller can read its text from left to right is considered standing.\\r\\nThe default state in which cards enter play is standing.\\r\\nA standing card is knelt by rotating it 90 degrees to the side.\\r\\nRelated: Enters Play, Kneel, Kneeling\\r\\nStanding Phase\\r\\nSee Appendix I, \"6. Standing phase\".\\r\\nStealth\\r\\nStealth is a keyword ability. When a player initiates a challenge, for each character with stealth he or she declares\\r\\nas an attacker, that player may choose one character without stealth controlled by the defending player. Each\\r\\nchosen character is considered bypassed by stealth, and cannot be declared as a defender for that challenge.\\r\\nRelated: Challenges Phase, Keywords\\r\\nSTR\\r\\nThe abbreviation for \"strength.\"\\r\\nStrength, Strength Modifiers\\r\\nA character\\'s strength (abbreviated \"STR\") represents its efectiveness in challenges.

If there are no valid targets at the time such\\r\\ntargets would be chosen, that aspect of the efect fails to resolve.\\r\\nA card is not an eligible target for an ability if the resolution of that ability\\'s efect could not afect the target\\r\\nat all. (For example, a kneeling character cannot be chosen as the target for an efect that reads, \"choose and kneel\\r\\na character.\")\\r\\nRelated: Delayed Efects, Initiating Abilities, The word \"Then\"\\r\\nTaxation Phase\\r\\nSee Appendix I, \"7. Taxation phase\".\\r\\nTerminal\\r\\nTerminal is a keyword ability that appears on attachment cards. If the card or game element to which a terminal\\r\\ncard is attached leaves play, the attachment does not return to its owner\\'s hand, and is discarded from play.\\r\\nRelated: Attachment Cards, Keywords\\r\\nThe word \"Then\"\\r\\nIf the efect text of an ability includes the word \"then,\" the text preceding the word \"then\" must be successfully\\r\\nresolved in full (i.e. the game state changes to reflect the intent of the pre-then aspect of the efect in its entirety)\\r\\nbefore the remainder of the efect described after the word \"then\" can be resolved.\\r\\nIf the pre-then aspect of an efect does successfully resolve in full, the resolution of the post-then aspect of\\r\\nthe efect must also attempt to resolve.\\r\\nIf the pre-then aspect of an efect does not successfully resolve in full, the post-then aspect does not attempt\\r\\nto resolve.\\r\\nTitle Cards, Title Pool (Melee game only)\\r\\nThe title cards are used only in the melee game. Each title provides unique capabilities to its bearer, and fosters\\r\\npolitical relationships among the players.\\r\\nThe title pool is created during game setup. It contains all of the title cards not currently controlled by a player.\\r\\nPlayers select a title from the title pool each round during the plot phase, and bear it throughout the round. While\\r\\na player bears a title, it is in play under his or her control.\\r\\nIn addition to creating rival and support relationships among the players (and to the textual or iconic abilities\\r\\ndescribed on the cards), each of the following titles also provides its bearer with a unique STR bonus for a specified\\r\\npart of the round.\\r\\nThe Crown Regent contributes 2 additional STR to its bearer\\'s total for dominance.\\r\\nThe Hand of the King contributes 1 additional STR to its bearer\\'s total during any [power] challenge in which he or\\r\\nshe controls a participating character.\\r\\nThe Master of Ships contributes 1 additional STR to its bearer\\'s total during any [military] challenge in which he or\\r\\nshe controls a participating character.\\r\\nThe Master of Whispers contributes 1 additional STR to its bearer\\'s total during any [intrigue] challenge in which\\r\\nhe or she controls a participating character.\\r\\nIf a player\\'s title card leaves play, it must be returned to the title pool.\\r\\nRelated: Melee Game, Plot Phase, Redirect, Rivals, Supports\\r\\nTokens, Running out of\\r\\nThere is no limit to the number of gold, power, or influence tokens which can be in the play area at a given time. If\\r\\nplayers run out of the provided tokens, other tokens, counters, or coins may be used to track the current game\\r\\nstate.\\r\\nTraits\\r\\nMost cards have one or more traits listed at the top of the text box and printed in bold italics.\\r\\nTraits have no inherent efect on the game. Instead, some card abilities reference cards that possess specific\\r\\ntraits.\\r\\nTreasury\\r\\nThe treasury is created during game setup and contains all of the tokens and counters not currently controlled by\\r\\nany player.\\r\\nWhen a player gains gold, that gold is taken from the treasury and added to the player\\'s gold pool. When a\\r\\nplayer spends gold to marshal a card or pay for an ability, that gold is returned to the treasury.\\r\\nWhen a card with any tokens or counters on it leaves play, those tokens or counters are returned to the\\r\\ntreasury.\\r\\nRelated: Setup, Gold, Influence Tokens, Power\\r\\nTriggered Abilities\\r\\nA triggered ability is any ability with a boldface precursor followed by a colon and the rest of the ability. This\\r\\nincludes actions, phase specific actions, interrupts, reactions, forced interrupts or reactions, and when revealed\\r\\nabilities.\\r\\nRelated: Abilities, Triggering Condition\\r\\nTriggering Condition\\r\\nA triggering condition is a specific occurrence that takes place in the game. On card abilities, the triggering\\r\\ncondition is the element of the ability that references such an occurrence, indicating the timing point at which the\\r\\nability may be used. The description of an ability\\'s triggering condition often follows the word \"when\" (for interrupt\\r\\nabilities) or the word \"after\" (for reaction abilities).\\r\\nIf a single occurrence creates multiple triggering conditions (such as two characters being killed simultaneously by\\r\\na claim 2 military challenge), those triggering conditions are handled in shared interrupt/ reaction windows, in\\r\\nwhich abilities that refer to any of the triggering conditions created by that occurrence may be used.\\r\\nThe following is a sequence of possible interrupt and reaction opportunities that exists around each triggering\\r\\ncondition that may arise in a game:\\r\\n1. The triggering condition becomes imminent. (In other words, if it is not canceled, changed, or otherwise pre\\x02empted by interrupt abilities, the triggering condition is the next thing that will occur in the game.)\\r\\n2. Interrupt abilities referencing when the imminent triggering condition \"would\" occur may be used. (Note that\\r\\nfor efects, a \"cancel\" interrupt may prevent the efect from initiating, and that the initiation of an efect is a\\r\\nseparate triggering condition, that comes before the resolution of the efect. \"Cancel\" interrupts are the only\\r\\ntype that will reference the initiation of an efect.) If the imminent triggering condition is canceled, none of the\\r\\nsubsequent steps in this sequence occur. If the triggering condition is changed, the original triggering\\r\\ncondition is no longer imminent, but the newly established triggering condition is now imminent (usually, this\\r\\nwill mean that a card that was about to leave play is now about to be saved).\\r\\n3. Forced interrupts to the imminent triggering condition must resolve, in the order determined by the first\\r\\nplayer.\\r\\n4. The interrupt window to the imminent triggering condition opens, and closes after all players consecutively\\r\\npass.\\r\\n5. The triggering condition itself occurs.\\r\\n6. Forced reactions to the triggering condition must resolve, in the order determined by the first player.\\r\\n7. The reaction window to the triggering condition opens, and closes after all players consecutively pass.\\r\\nRelated: Cancel, Initiating Abilities, Interrupts, Reactions, The word \"Would\"\\r\\nUnique Cards\\r\\nA card with the [unique] symbol before its card title is a \"unique\" card. Each player may only own or control a\\r\\nmaximum of one instance of each unique card, by title, in play.\\r\\nA player may marshal (or put into play by a card ability) additional copies of each unique card he or she owns\\r\\nand controls, placed as a duplicate on that card, for no cost.\\r\\nA player cannot take control of a unique card if he or she already controls or owns an in-play copy of that\\r\\ncard.\\r\\nA player cannot bring into play or take control of a unique card if a copy of that card is in his or her dead pile.\\r\\nRelated: Dead Pile, Duplicates, Ownership and Control\\r\\nUnopposed, Unopposed Challenge\\r\\nA challenge is \"unopposed\" if the defending player counts 0 STR when the challenge winner is determined. This can\\r\\noccur if the defending player controls no participating characters, or if there are defending characters but the total\\r\\ndefending STR is 0.\\r\\nWhen a player wins an unopposed challenge as the attacker, that player gains 1 power for his or her faction\\r\\ncard. This occurs during framework step 4.2.3 (see Appendix I), and is known as an unopposed bonus.\\r\\nUsed Pile\\r\\nSee \"Plot Card\".\\r\\nWhen Revealed\\r\\nA When Revealed ability contains the boldface \"When Revealed:\" precursor. Such an ability must resolve\\r\\nwhenever a plot card bearing it is revealed.\\r\\nSee timing step \"1.3 Reveal plots\".\\r\\nWinning a Challenge\\r\\nEach challenge is won by the player who counts the highest total STR for his or her side when the challenge result\\r\\nis determined.\\r\\nA player\\'s total STR is the sum of the STR of each participating character on his or her side of the challenge,\\r\\nalong with any other modifiers that are afecting the amount of STR that player counts for that challenge.\\r\\nA player must count at least 1 total STR and there must be at least 1 participating character on his or her side\\r\\nin order to win a challenge.\\r\\nIf the total STR counted on each side is tied at a value of 1 or greater (and the attacker controls at least 1\\r\\nparticipating character), the attacker wins the challenge.\\r\\nIf neither player can meet the requirements of winning a challenge, neither player wins (or loses) that\\r\\nchallenge.\\r\\nRelated: Challenges Phase, Claim, Unopposed\\r\\nWinning the Game\\r\\nThe first player to have 15 (or more) power on cards he or she controls wins the game. The game ends immediately\\r\\nif a player meets the victory condition of having 15 (or more) power.\\r\\nIf multiple players would reach this victory condition simultaneously, the first player determines which of\\r\\nthose players wins the game.\\r\\nA player is eliminated from the game when his or her draw deck has no cards remaining. If all of a player\\'s\\r\\nopponents are eliminated from the game, the remaining player wins the game. (If all remaining players\\r\\nwould be eliminated simultaneously, the first player determines the order in which those players are\\r\\neliminated.)\\r\\nThe word \"Would\"\\r\\nThe word \"would\" is used to define the triggering condition of some interrupt abilities, and establishes a higher\\r\\npriority for those abilities than interrupts to the same triggering condition that lack the word \"would.\"\\r\\nAll \"would be X\" interrupts are eligible to be used before any \"is X\" interrupts. This means that an interrupt with the\\r\\nword \"would\" (such as \"when a character would be killed\") has timing priority over an interrupt without the word\\r\\n\"would\" to the same occurrence (such as \"when a character is killed\").\\r\\nIf an interrupt to a triggering condition that would occur changes the nature of that which is about to occur\\r\\n(such as saving a character that would be killed), no further interrupts to the original trigger may be used, as\\r\\nthe resolution of that trigger is no longer imminent.\\r\\nRelated: Cancel, Interrupts, Replacement Efects, Save\\r\\nThe letter \"X\"\\r\\nUnless specified by a card ability or granted player choice, the letter X is always equal to 0. For costs involving the\\r\\nletter X, the value of X is defined by card ability or player choice, after which the amount paid may be modified by\\r\\nefects without altering the value of X.\\r\\nComponent List\\r\\nFor reference, the game components included in the core set are:\\r\\n28 Plot cards\\r\\n20 Stark cards\\r\\n20 Lannister cards\\r\\n20 Baratheon cards\\r\\n20 Greyjoy cards\\r\\n20 Targaryen cards\\r\\n20 Martell cards\\r\\n20 Tyrell cards\\r\\n20 Night\\'s Watch cards\\r\\n31 Neutral cards\\r\\n1 Fealty Agenda card\\r\\n8 Faction/Agenda cards\\r\\n6 Melee title cards\\r\\n30 Gold tokens\\r\\n30 Power counters\\r\\n10 Influence tokens\\r\\n1 First Player token\\r\\nAppendix I: Timing and Gameplay\\r\\nOur friends at the Friendly Open have graciously provided us with a 1-page cheatsheet for the game\\'s timing and\\r\\ngameplay framework.\\r\\nPlease use the linked thumbnails below to access this supplement in the indicated format.\\r\\nFor a detailed breakdown of the framework please keep on reading below.\\r\\nNumbered items presented in the darker boxes are known as framework events. Framework events are\\r\\nmandatory occurrences dictated by the structure of the game. Yellow windows are framework events that only\\r\\noccur when playing the melee format of the game. Grey windows are special framework events that indicate the\\r\\npossibility of the game returning to an earlier framework event in the chart. These repetitive sequences can end in\\r\\nvarious ways, such as when all players have performed the steps in the sequence, or when a player makes a\\r\\nspecific decision. Each grey window explains when and how the game either loops back or progresses to a later\\r\\nframework event.\\r\\nAction Windows\\r\\nAn Action may only be initiated during an action window. Action windows are presented in red boxes on the chart.\\r\\nWhen an action window opens, the first player has the first opportunity to initiate an action, or pass. Opportunities\\r\\nto initiate actions rotate between the players in player order until all players consecutively pass, at which point the\\r\\naction window closes. (Note that if a player passes his or her opportunity to act, but the other opponents do not\\r\\nconsecutively pass in sequence, the original player may still take an action when the rotation of action\\r\\nopportunities comes back around to the original player.)\\r\\nResolve each action completely before the next action opportunity.\\r\\nReactions and Interrupts\\r\\nAn Interrupt or Reaction ability can interrupt or react to the resolution of a framework event if the triggering\\r\\ncondition of the ability is met.\\r\\nEach reaction or interrupt must resolve completely before the next interrupt or reaction to the same triggering\\r\\ncondition may initiate.\\r\\nFor example: An ability that reads, \"Reaction: After you win a challenge...\" initiates after step (4.2.2) of the\\r\\nchallenge resolution framework event is complete.\\r\\nTiming Sequence Chart\\r\\nFramework Event Details\\r\\nThis section provides a detailed explanation on how to handle each framework event step presented on the game\\'s\\r\\nflow chart, in the order that the framework events occur throughout the round.\\r\\n1. Plot phase\\r\\n1.1 Plot phase begins\\r\\nThis step formalizes the beginning of the plot phase. As this is the first framework event of the round, it also\\r\\nformalizes the beginning of a new game round.\\r\\nThe beginning of a phase is an important game milestone that may be referenced in card text, either as a point at\\r\\nwhich an ability may or must resolve, or as a point at which a lasting efect or constant ability begins or expires.\\r\\n1.2 Choose plots\\r\\nEach player looks at the cards remaining in his or her plot deck, and chooses one to reveal during the next\\r\\nframework step. The chosen plot is placed facedown apart from the plot deck, and not revealed to other players\\r\\nduring this step.\\r\\nOnce each player has chosen a plot and placed it facedown away from his or her plot deck, this step is complete.\\r\\n1.3 Reveal plots\\r\\nThe players simultaneously reveal each of the plot cards that were chosen during step 1.2 by turning those cards\\r\\nfaceup.\\r\\nWhen a player\\'s plot card is revealed, it is placed on top of his or her previously revealed plot card. All plot cards\\r\\nbeneath a player\\'s currently revealed plot card are considered that player\\'s \"used pile.\"\\r\\nThe act of revealing plot cards for this framework event involves three steps, performed in this order:\\r\\nI. Compare initiative. The player with the highest initiative value on his or her revealed plot card (which\\r\\nincorporates all relevant initiative modifiers) wins initiative. If multiple players have the same initiative value, the\\r\\ntied player with the lowest power total wins initiative. If the players\\' initiative and power totals are both tied, the tie\\r\\nis broken by randomly selecting one of the tied players.\\r\\nII. Choose first player. The player who won initiative in step I chooses a player to be the first player. The chosen\\r\\nplayer takes the first player token and keeps it until another card or game efect (usually this step in the following\\r\\nround) selects a new first player.\\r\\nNote: If a player reveals a new plot card outside the standard plot phase framework step (for instance, by resolving\\r\\na card ability), steps I and II are skipped: there is no new initiative comparison or determination of a new first\\r\\nplayer.\\r\\nIII. Initiate When Revealed abilities. Any when revealed abilities on plot cards that have just been revealed must\\r\\nnow initiate. If multiple players have When revealed abilities on their plot cards, the first player determines the\\r\\norder in which these abilities initiate. Resolve each when revealed ability before initiating the next.\\r\\nOnce these steps are complete, the players have completed the process of revealing plots. If a player has no cards\\r\\nin his or her plot deck, that player\\'s used pile now returns to his or her plot deck. (The just revealed plot is not yet\\r\\nin the used pile and does not return at this time.)\\r\\nTIMING NOTE: Any reaction abilities that read \"After you reveal a plot card\" or \"After a player reveals a plot card\" may be\\r\\ninitiated after the completion of the above step III.\\r\\n1.4 Select titles (melee format only)\\r\\nIf the players are playing a melee game, they now select titles for the round. In a joust game, this framework step is\\r\\nskipped.\\r\\nFirst, shufe the six titles facedown and remove one at random from the title pool. If three players are playing,\\r\\nremove two at random instead. If six or more players are playing, no titles are removed.\\r\\nThe first player then looks at the remaining titles in the title pool, and takes one without revealing his or her\\r\\nselection to the other players. The remaining titles are passed in player order, with each player selecting one title in\\r\\nthis manner. After all players have selected, any unselected titles (including the titles that were randomly removed\\r\\nat the beginning of this step) are returned facedown to the title pool, and each selected title is turned face up in\\r\\nfront of the player who selected it. Each selected title enters play simultaneously, is considered in play under its\\r\\nbearer\\'s control, and may interact with the game state until it is returned to the title pool.\\r\\nIf more than six players are playing in a melee game, any player who would be selecting a title from an empty title\\r\\npool plays the round without a title.\\r\\n1.5 Plot phase ends\\r\\nThis step formalizes the end of the plot phase.\\r\\nThe end of a phase is an important game milestone that may be referenced in card text, either as a point at which\\r\\nan ability may or must resolve, or as a point at which a lasting efect or constant ability expires or begins.\\r\\n2. Draw phase\\r\\n2.1 Draw phase begins\\r\\nThis step formalizes the beginning of the draw phase.\\r\\n2.2 Draw\\r\\nEach player must simultaneously draw 2 cards from the top of his or her draw deck.\\r\\nNote: A player is eliminated from the game immediately if there are no cards remaining in his or her deck. If all\\r\\nremaining players are eliminated while fulfilling this step, the first player determines which of those players is the\\r\\nwinner of the game.\\r\\n2.3 Draw phase ends\\r\\nThis step formalizes the end of the draw phase.\\r\\n3. Marshaling phase\\r\\n3.1 Marshaling phase begins\\r\\nThis step formalizes the beginning of the marshaling phase.\\r\\n3.2 Active player collects income\\r\\nThe first player is first to be the active player in the marshaling phase.\\r\\nThe active player collects income equal to the gold value on his or her revealed plot card (which incorporates all\\r\\nrelevant gold modifiers), and gains that much gold from the treasury, adding it to his or her gold pool.\\r\\nMarshaling phase player action window\\r\\nThe first player always has the first opportunity to act during this action window.\\r\\nIn addition to being permitted to initiate \"Action\" and \"Marshaling Action\" abilities (like all players), the active player\\r\\nis also permitted (when it is his or her turn to act) to, as a player action, marshal a character, location, attachment,\\r\\nor duplicate. Action opportunities in this window continue in player order until each player has consecutively\\r\\npassed.\\r\\nTIMING NOTE: Any player may also initiate Interrupt or Reaction abilities if the appropriate triggering condition occurs.\\r\\nTo marshal a card, a player returns an amount of gold equal to the card\\'s gold cost from his or her gold pool to the\\r\\ntreasury.\\r\\nWhen a player marshals a character card, the card is placed in the front row of that player\\'s play area.\\r\\nWhen a player marshals a location card, the card is placed in the back row of that player\\'s play area.\\r\\nWhen a player marshals an attachment card, the card is attached to another card or game element in play. Some\\r\\nattachments have play restrictions or permissions that describe the type of card or game element to which they\\r\\nmust be attached. If an attachment does not have any such restriction or permission, the default state for an\\r\\nattachment is that it attaches to a character.\\r\\nWhen a player marshals a duplicate, it is placed faceup, overlapped by (i.e. partially visible beneath) the copy of the\\r\\ncard that was already in play. There is no cost to marshal a duplicate.\\r\\nAction opportunities continue clockwise in player order among the players until all players consecutively pass, at\\r\\nwhich point the action window closes. As such, there is no upper limit on the number of opportunities an active\\r\\nplayer may have to marshal his or her cards.\\r\\n3.3 Next player becomes active player\\r\\nIf upon reaching this step all players have been the active player this phase, proceed to step 3.4.\\r\\nOtherwise, the next player (in player order) becomes the active player. Return to step 3.2.\\r\\n3.4 Marshaling phase ends\\r\\nThis step formalizes the end of the marshaling phase.\\r\\n4. Challenges phase\\r\\n4.1 Challenges phase begins\\r\\nThis step formalizes the beginning of the challenges phase.\\r\\n4.2 Active player may initiate a challenge\\r\\nThe first player is the first to be the active player in the challenges phase.\\r\\nThe game permits the active player to initiate one [military], one [intrigue], and one [power] challenge (in any\\r\\norder) while he or she is the active player during the challenges phase.\\r\\nIf the active player passes this opportunity to initiate a challenge, or cannot initiate a challenge, proceed to step\\r\\n4.3.\\r\\nTo initiate a challenge, the active player does the following. The game treats these criteria as being performed\\r\\natomically (all at once), and they must all be completed together in order to initiate a challenge.\\r\\nAnnounces the type of challenge ([military], [intrigue], or [power]) being initiated.\\r\\nAnnounces the opponent against whom the challenge is being initiated.\\r\\nAnnounces which characters (under his or her control) are being declared as attackers, and kneels them\\r\\nsimultaneously. In order to be eligible as an attacker, a character must have a challenge icon that\\r\\ncorresponds with the type of challenge being initiated, and the character must be standing. At least one\\r\\ncharacter must be declared as an attacker to initiate a challenge. Any character with the stealth keyword that\\r\\nhas been declared as an attacker also chooses its stealth targets at this time if its controller desires to use\\r\\nthe stealth keyword.\\r\\nTIMING NOTE: Once a challenge is initiated, reactions to any of the above announcements may be initiated.\\r\\nTIMING NOTE: Once a challenge is initiated, it is considered to be resolving until the challenge ends in step 4.2.6.\\r\\n4.2.1 Defending player declares defenders\\r\\nThe defending player has the option to declare eligible characters he or she controls as defenders, and kneels\\r\\nthem simultaneously. In order to be eligible as a defender, a character must have a challenge icon that\\r\\ncorresponds with the type of challenge that is currently underway, and the character must be standing. A character\\r\\nthat was chosen as a stealth target in step 4.2 is not eligible to be declared as a defender.\\r\\n4.2.2 Compare STR to determine challenge winner\\r\\nCompare the combined STR of all attacking characters (plus any active modifiers) to the combined STR of all\\r\\ndefending characters (plus any active modifiers) to determine the challenge winner.\\r\\nThe player whose side has the higher total STR wins the challenge (or in the case of a tie, the challenge is won by\\r\\nthe attacking player). If this player does not have a total STR of 1 or higher, and/or if there are no participating\\r\\ncharacters on this player\\'s side when this step (i.e., the STR comparison) occurs, neither player wins (or loses) the\\r\\nchallenge.\\r\\nIf the attacking player is the winner, and the total STR on the defending side of the challenge was 0, the challenge is\\r\\nconsidered \"unopposed.\"\\r\\nTIMING NOTE: Reactions to winning and/or losing the challenge may be initiated after the completion of this step.\\r\\n4.2.3 Gain challenge bonuses\\r\\nIf the challenge was unopposed in the previous step, the attacking player gains 1 power for his or her faction card\\r\\nfor winning an unopposed challenge. This is known as an unopposed bonus.\\r\\nIn a melee game, if the challenge was won against an opponent bearing a title which is denoted as a Rival on the\\r\\nwinning player\\'s title (and the challenge winner has not already claimed power for defeating that Rival this round),\\r\\nthe challenge winner gains 1 power for his or her faction. This is known as a rivals bonus.\\r\\nAll challenge bonuses a player receives for this step are gained simultaneously.\\r\\n4.2.4 Apply claim result.\\r\\nIf the attacking player is the challenge winner, the claim result of the challenge is now applied. The claim result for\\r\\neach challenge type resolves as follows, using the claim value on the attacking player\\'s revealed plot card (and\\r\\nincorporating all relevant claim modifiers):\\r\\nMilitary: The defending player must choose a number of diferent characters under his or her control equal\\r\\nto the claim value, and kill those characters. (The chosen characters do not have to be characters that\\r\\nparticipated in the challenge.)\\r\\nIntrigue: The defending player must discard, at random, a number of cards from his or her hand equal to\\r\\nthe claim value.\\r\\nPower: The defending player removes a number of power counters from his or her faction card equal to the\\r\\nclaim value, and moves them to the attacking player\\'s faction card.\\r\\nIf the defending player wins the challenge, no claim result occurs.\\r\\n4.2.5 Process challenge resolution keywords\\r\\nChallenge resolution keywords (e.g. insight, intimidate, pillage, and renown) take efect at this time. The first player\\r\\ndetermines the order, by keyword type, in which these keywords are processed. The first player chooses one\\r\\nkeyword type (for instance, renown), and then all relevant instances of that keyword resolve simultaneously. The\\r\\nfirst player then chooses the next keyword type to resolve, and so on, until all keyword types that need to resolve\\r\\nupon the resolution of the challenge have been processed.\\r\\n4.2.6 Challenge ends\\r\\nThis step formalizes the end of the challenge. All characters that were participating in the challenge are no longer\\r\\nparticipating. Proceed to the action window between framework steps 4.1 and 4.2.\\r\\n4.3 Next player becomes active player\\r\\nIf the active player does not declare a challenge, or cannot initiate any more challenges, the next player in player\\r\\norder becomes the active player. Proceed to the player action window between framework steps 4.1 and 4.2.\\r\\nIf all players have been the active player this phase, proceed to 4.4.\\r\\n4.4 Challenges phase ends\\r\\nThis step formalizes the end of the challenges phase.\\r\\n5. Dominance phase\\r\\n5.1 Dominance phase begins\\r\\nThis step formalizes the beginning of the dominance phase.\\r\\n5.2 Determine dominance\\r\\nEach player simultaneously counts the total combined STR of all of his or her standing characters, and adds 1 to\\r\\nthis total for each gold token in his or her gold pool. The player with the highest total wins dominance for the\\r\\nround, and gains 1 power for his or her faction. (Note: a player may win dominance with no standing characters.)\\r\\nIf there is a tie for the highest total, no player wins dominance.\\r\\n5.3 Dominance phase ends\\r\\nThis step formalizes the end of the dominance phase.\\r\\n6. Standing phase\\r\\n6.1 Standing phase begins\\r\\nThis step formalizes the beginning of the standing phase.\\r\\n6.2 Stand cards\\r\\nSimultaneously stand each kneeling card in play.\\r\\n6.3 Standing phase ends\\r\\nThis step formalizes the end of the standing phase.\\r\\n7. Taxation phase\\r\\n7.1 Taxation phase begins\\r\\nThis step formalizes the beginning of the taxation phase.\\r\\n7.2 Return unspent gold\\r\\nEach player simultaneously returns all unspent gold in his or her gold pool to the treasury.\\r\\n7.3 Check reserve\\r\\nEach player, in player order, checks his or her reserve.\\r\\nAny player with more cards in hand than the reserve value on his or her revealed plot card (which incorporates all\\r\\nrelevant reserve modifiers) chooses and discards cards from his or her hand until that player\\'s hand size and\\r\\nreserve value are equal.\\r\\nA player is not permitted to discard cards from his or her hand at this time while at or below his or her reserve\\r\\nvalue.\\r\\n7.4 Return melee title cards (melee format only)\\r\\nEach player returns his or her title to the title pool. All titles leave play simultaneously. (In a joust game, this step is\\r\\nskipped.)\\r\\n7.5 Taxation phase ends\\r\\nThis step formalizes the end of the taxation phase.\\r\\nAs the taxation phase is the final phase in the round, this step also formalizes the end of the round. Any active\\r\\n\"until the end of the round\" lasting efects expire at this time.\\r\\nAfter this step is complete, play proceeds to the beginning of the plot phase of the next game round.\\r\\nAbout API Donators \\uf06b Clear data\\r\\nDesigned and built by Alsciende.\\r\\nMaintained by stopfstedt Contact: \\uf0e0\\r\\nCards data maintained with great dedication by the TheIronThrone.net team.\\r\\nPlease post bug reports and feature requests on GitHub.\\r\\nYou may contribute by giving money on Paypal.\\r\\nThe information presented on this site about A Game\\r\\nof Thrones: The Card Game Second Edition, both literal\\r\\nand graphical, is copyrighted by Fantasy Flight Games.\\r\\nThis website is not produced, endorsed, supported, or\\r\\nafliated with Fantasy Flight Games.\\n')]"
